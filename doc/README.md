Djerba documentation
====================

The `doc` directory contains additional documentation and examples.

## HTML documentation

[HTML documentation](./html/djerba/index.html) pages were generated using [pdoc3](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/). These incorporate documentation strings from source code, and show the structure of classes and methods.

## Input JSON schema

Described in [schema.md](./schema.md).

## Elba config output

- [elba_config_example.json](./elba_config_example.json) is an example of the current JSON spec for the Elba report configuration. As of 2020-10-19, Elba config structure is not officially finalised; but there should be little or no difference between this and the final version.
- **TODO:** Supplement the example JSON output file with a formal [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/).
