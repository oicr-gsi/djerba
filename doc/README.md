Djerba documentation
====================

The `doc` directory contains additional documentation and examples.

## elba_config.json

`elba_config.json` is a JSON spec for the Elba report configuration. It was presented at the [2020-09-15 CGI meeting](https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=GSI&title=2020-09-15+CGI+Meeting).

This document is being used as a template for developing Djerba output in `elba` mode.

TODO: Replace the template JSON file with a formal [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/).
