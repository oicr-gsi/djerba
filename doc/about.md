# Introduction

## About Djerba

[Djerba](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba) is a system for generating [clinical report documents](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba/blob/main/examples/WGTS/PLACEHOLDER-v1_report.clinical.pdf) from pipeline data, with a modular structure based on plugins. It is named after a [Mediterranean island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djerba) and pronounced "jerba" (the initial letter D is silent).

The [djerba-demo](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba-demo) repository allows you to quickly install, test, and run Djerba.
