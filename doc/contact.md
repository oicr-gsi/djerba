To contact the Djerba developers, email [gsi@oicr.on.ca](mailto:gsi@oicr.on.ca) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba/issues).

Djerba is maintained by the Clinical Genome Informatics (CGI) team, part of the Genome Sequence Informatics (GSI) group at the [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca/) (OICR). Bug reports and suggestions for new features are welcome, however the team's primary focus is supporting ongoing research and clinical trials at OICR. Code changes other than production-critical bug fixes are a lower priority, and action on them may be delayed. Thank you for your understanding.
