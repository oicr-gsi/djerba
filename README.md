Modular system to create reports from metadata and workflow output

## Introduction

The Djerba software:
- translates cancer bioinformatics workflow outputs and metadata into clinical reports;
- has a modular structure based on plugins;
- is named for an [island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djerba) off the coast of North Africa -- the initial letter D is silent, so it is pronounced "jerba";
- is developed and maintained by the Clinical Genome Informatics (CGI) group at [OICR](https://oicr.on.ca).

## Documentation

- This document is intended as a very brief introduction to Djerba.
- The main site for Djerba documentation is [ReadTheDocs](https://djerba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- A general overview is given by [slides from a talk on Djerba](./doc/Iain_Bancarz_presentation_CGC_2023_Djerba.pdf) by Iain Bancarz at [CGC 2023](https://cancergenomics.org/meetings/cgc_annual_meeting_2023.php) on 2023-08-14.

## Structure

### Workflow steps

Generating a report with Djerba has the following steps:
1. **Configure** an INI file
2. **Extract** metrics to a JSON file
3. **Render** the JSON to HTML
4. **Publish** the HTML as PDF

In addition, Djerba supports:
- *Archiving* the JSON report documents to a [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) database.
- *Updating* a JSON document with revised summary text and/or PHI (as of version 1.3.0).

### Software components

Reports are generated by the following types of component:
- **Core:** Central element of Djerba. Runs other components, as specified in the INI config file, to generate a report.
- **Plugin:** Main component type. Has its own configure, extract, and render operations.
- **Helper:** Writes ancillary files for use by plugins.
- **Merger:** Merges inputs from multiple plugins to generate an HTML section.

The report document is made up of one or more _sections_, generated by running plugins, helpers, and mergers in a specific order.

## History

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed development history. In brief:

- **2020-09**: Early prototype addressing [cBioPortal](https://cbioportal.org/) as well as the CGI clinical reporting format.
