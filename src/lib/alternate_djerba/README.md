# alternate_djerba

This package exists solely to test Djerba's functionality for loading plugins from multiple packages, added in release 1.6.0. It contains a single `demo4` plugin, which is a renamed version of the old `demo1` plugin.

It is *not* intended for production plugins, which should go into a package with a more descriptive name.
