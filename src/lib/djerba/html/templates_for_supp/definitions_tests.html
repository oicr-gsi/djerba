<p><strong>Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB): </strong> The number of somatic, coding, non-synonymous base substitutions and short insertions and deletions (indels) per megabase of tumour genome .

<br><strong>Percent Genome Altered (PGA): </strong>The fraction of the genome with evidence of copy number change, for a given sample. PGA is calculated as the fraction of the genome where the absolute value of log<sub>2</sub> of the tumor / normal depth ratio is &#8805 0.2 , using copy number segment data produced by Sequenza.

<p><strong>Cohort: </strong>If available, the name of an external dataset used to calculate TMB percentile. Percentiles for tumour mutation burden (TMB) are plotted and reported against the corresponding cohort(s).

<br><strong>All TCGA Percentile: </strong>Percentile of TMB scores are plotted relative to <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas">all TCGA samples</a> (${genomic_landscape_info.get(constants.PAN_CANCER_COHORT)}).
<br><strong>TCGA Cohort Percentile: </strong>Percentile of TMB scores are plotted relative to <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas">closest TCGA sample cohort</a>
