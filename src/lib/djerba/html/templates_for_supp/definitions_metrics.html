<strong>Callability: </strong>The percentage of bases above 30x in tumour sample. Callability above 75% is considered a pass.
<br><strong>Coverage: </strong>Mean number of bases covering each sequenced base. Minimum coverage threshold is ${coverage_thresholds.get(constants.TUMOUR_MIN)}x for the tumour (with a target of ${coverage_thresholds.get(constants.TUMOUR_TARGET)}x); ${coverage_thresholds.get(constants.NORMAL_MIN)}x for the normal (with a target of ${coverage_thresholds.get(constants.NORMAL_TARGET)}x).
<br><strong>Estimated Cancer Cell Content (%): </strong>The inferred tumour purity as determined using Sequenza.
<br><strong>Estimated Ploidy: </strong>The inferred tumour ploidy as determined using Sequenza.
