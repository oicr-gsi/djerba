<p>Based on a minimum tumour purity of 30%, the sensitivity for SNVs and INDELs is 96% and 89%, respectively. The sensitivity for CNVs and FNA fusions is 86% and 32%, respectively. The limit of detection is 10% VAF for SNVs and 20% for INDELs.</p>
<p>Variant prioritization is based on OncoKB actionable tiers (described below). In addition, variants without an OncoKB actionable tier are reported if they are listed as oncogenic, likely oncogenic or predicted oncogenic.</p>
<p><strong>Genes tested</strong>: Although whole genome sequencing encompasses all genes in a specimen, this report is restricted to cancer genes as defined by OncoKB as of the date this report.</p>
<p>Assay results are collated into the report document by <a href="https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba">Djerba</a> (${djerba_version}).</p>
