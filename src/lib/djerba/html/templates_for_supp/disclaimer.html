<p>Based on a minimum tumour purity of 30%, the sensitivity for SNVs and in/dels is 96% and 89%, respectively. 
    The sensitivity for CNVs and RNA fusions is 86% and 32%, respectively. 
    The limit of detection is 10% VAF for SNVs and 20% for in/dels.</p>
<p>Copy Number (CN) changes were called as amplifications when the log<sub>2</sub> allele-ratio was greater than 0.78, corresponding to a minimum copy number of 4 in a diploid tumour with 100% cancer cell content. 
    Copy Number (CN) changes were called as deletions when the log<sub>2</sub> allele-ratio was less than -3.8, corresponding to a homozygous copy number deletion in a diploid tumour with 100% cancer cell content. 
    As the log2 allele-ratio thresholds scale with tumour purity, absolute copy number may be lower than predicted in tumours with lower cancer cell content.</p>
