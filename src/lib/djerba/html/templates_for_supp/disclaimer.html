<p>Based on a minimum tumour purity of 30%, the sensitivity for SNVs and in/dels is 96% and 89%, respectively. 
    The sensitivity for CNVs and RNA fusions is 86% and 32%, respectively. 
    The limit of detection is 10% VAF for SNVs and 20% for in/dels. The limit of detection for MSI is cellularity >50%.</p>
