<p>In addition, variants without an OncoKB actionable tier are reported if they are listed as oncogenic, likely oncogenic or predicted oncogenic. <br>
    <br>  When provided, results and interpretations are consistent with available knowledge for the given tumour type as defined in <a href="http://oncotree.mskcc.org/">OncoTree</a>. OncoKB tiers are tumour-specific and dependant on OncoTree definitions. </p>
