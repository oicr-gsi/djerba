<p>For whole transcriptome sequencing, WT libraries are prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit with RNA extracted from FFPE or fresh frozen tissue tissue. Paired-end sequencing is performed using the NovaSeq6000 technology. Reads are aligned using <a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">STAR</a> (2.7.3a) and expressions quantified using <a href="https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM">RSEM</a> (1.3.3). Fusions are called using <a href="https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki">STAR-Fusion</a> (1.8.1) and <a href="https://github.com/suhrig/arriba">Arriba</a> (1.2.0), followed by post processing with <a href="https://github.com/bcgsc/mavis">MAVIS</a> (2.2.6). </p>
