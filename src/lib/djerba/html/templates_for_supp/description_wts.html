<p>Whole Transcriptome libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq6000 technology. Reads were aligned using <a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">STAR</a> (${versions.get(constants.STAR_VERSION)}) and gene expression levels quantified using <a href="https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM">RSEM</a> (${versions.get(constants.RSEM_VERSION)}). Fusions were called using <a href="https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki">STAR-Fusion</a> (${versions.get(constants.STARFUSION_VERSION)}) and <a href="https://github.com/suhrig/arriba">Arriba</a> (${versions.get(constants.ARRIBA_VERSION)}), followed by post processing with <a href="https://github.com/bcgsc/mavis">MAVIS</a> (${versions.get(constants.MAVIS_VERSION)}) and annotation using OncoKB. </p>
