<p>Whole Transcriptome libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq6000 technology. Reads were aligned using <a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">STAR</a> (${constants.STAR_VERSION}) and gene expression levels quantified using <a href="https://github.com/deweylab/RSEM">RSEM</a> (${constants.RSEM_VERSION}). Fusions were called using <a href="https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki">STAR-Fusion</a> (${constants.STARFUSION_VERSION}) and <a href="https://github.com/suhrig/arriba">Arriba</a> (${constants.ARRIBA_VERSION}), followed by post processing with <a href="https://github.com/bcgsc/mavis">MAVIS</a> (${constants.MAVIS_VERSION}) and annotation using OncoKB. </p>
