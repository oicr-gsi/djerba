Based on a minimum tumour purity of 65%, the sensitivity for SNVs and in/dels is 96% and 77.7%, respectively. 
The sensitivity for CNVs and RNA fusions is 100% and 32%, respectively. 
The limit of detection is 10% VAF for SNVs and 20% for in/dels. The limit of detection for MSI is cellularity >50%. 
For HRD, the sensitivity is 83% and the specificity is 90%. The lower limit of detection is >50% cellularity in FFPE samples and >30% cellularity in fresh frozen samples.
For LOH, the sensitivity and specificity are both 100%. LOH is currently reported for autosomes; LOH on the X chromosome is not reported.
Although whole genome sequencing encompasses all genes in a specimen, this report is restricted to cancer genes defined by OncoKB as of the date the report is issued.
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by OICR Genomics. It has not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
