<p>Based on a minimum tumour purity of 65%, the sensitivity for SNVs and in/dels is 96% and 77.7%, respectively. The sensitivity for CNVs and RNA fusions is 96.3% and 32%, respectively. The limit of detection is 10% VAF for SNVs and 20% for in/dels. The limit of detection for MSI is cellularity >50%.</p>
<p>Although whole genome sequencing encompasses all genes in a specimen, this report is restricted to cancer genes defined by OncoKB as of the date the report is issued.</p>
