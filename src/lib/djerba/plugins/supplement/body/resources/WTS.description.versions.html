<p>Whole Transcriptome libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. 
  Paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina ${versions.ILLUMINA_VERSION} technology. 
  Reads were aligned using <a href=${versions.STAR_LINK}>STAR</a> (${versions.STAR_VERSION}) 
  and gene expression levels quantified using <a href=${versions.RSEM_LINK}>RSEM</a> (${versions.RSEM_VERSION}). 
  Fusions were called using <a href=${versions.STARFUSION_LINK}>STAR-Fusion</a> (${versions.STARFUSION_VERSION}) 
  and <a href=${versions.ARRIBA_LINK}>Arriba</a> (${versions.ARRIBA_VERSION}), followed by post processing with 
  <a href=${versions.MAVIS_LINK}>MAVIS</a> (${versions.MAVIS_VERSION}) and annotation using
  <a href="https://api.oncokb.org/oncokb-annotator/gene-annotation">OncoKB</a> and the NCCN Compendium of biomarkers.
  The NCCN Compendium is a set of manually compiled translocations to be reported in
  <a href="https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/myeloma_blocks.pdf">Plasma Cell Myeloma</a>
  (PCM) cases, and HRD to be reported for
  <a href="https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/ovarian_blocks.pdf">Ovarian</a> tumours.
