Based on a minimum coverage of 30X, the sensitivity is 93%. The limit of detection is 0.4% ctDNA.
<br>Minimal Residual Disease testing by Plasma whole genome sequencing encompasses all genomic regions in a specimen. 
Gene annotation is not performed in this assay and variants are not classified (e.g. by pathogeneity). 
<br>This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by OICR Genomics. 
It has not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
