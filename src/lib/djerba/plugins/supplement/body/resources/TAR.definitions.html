<p><strong>Raw Coverage (Mean):</strong>Average number of bases covering each sequenced base. Target coverage is 15,000x for the tumour, and 5,000x for the normal.</p>
<p><strong>Unique Molecular Coverage(Mean):</strong>Average number of bases covering each sequenced base after Unique molecule based error suppression. Minimum coverage is 400x for the tumour, and 400x for the normal.</p>   
<p><strong>Estimated Cancer Cell Content (%):</strong>The inferred tumour purity as determined using ichorCNA</p>
<p><strong>Copy State:</strong> Copy state changes were called according to the log<sub>2</sub> coverage-ratio, which can be used to calculate an approximate minimum copy number for a diploid tumour with 100% cancer cell content. As the log<sub>2</sub> coverage-ratio thresholds scale with tumour purity, absolute copy number may be lower than predicted, in tumours with lower cancer cell content. Calls represent levels derived from copy-number analysis, are used for annotation by OncoKB, and indicate the copy-number level per gene, as follows: </p>
