<p><strong>Copy State:</strong> Copy state changes were called according to the log<sub>2</sub> coverage-ratio, which can be used to calculate an approximate minimum copy number for a diploid tumour with 100% cancer cell content. As the log<sub>2</sub> coverage-ratio thresholds scale with tumour purity, absolute copy number may be lower than predicted, in tumours with lower cancer cell content. Calls represent levels derived from copy-number analysis, are used for annotation by OncoKB, and indicate the copy-number level per gene, as follows: </p>

  <tr>
    <td>Amplification</td>
    <td>a high-level amplification (more copies, often focal)</td>
  </tr>
