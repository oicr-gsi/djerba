  FOR sWGS, The sensitivity is 74.2% and the specificity is 99.4% when recalling amplifications from a Tumour / Normal pair in shallow whole genome sequencing. The limit of detection is &#8805; 1.4-fold change for gene amplifications in a 10% tumour purity. 
  FOR SNV/INDEL, The sensitivity and specificity for FFPE samples is 95.5% and 94.1%. For cfDNA samples the sensitivity is 84% and the specificity is 97%. The limit of detection was determined to be 1% at a minimum collapsed coverage of 400x, with at least 3 supporting reads.
  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by OICR Genomics. It has not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
