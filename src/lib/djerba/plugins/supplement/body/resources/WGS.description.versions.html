Whole Genome libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep kit with DNA extracted from FFPE or fresh frozen tissue (for tumour samples) 
or buffy coat blood specimens (for matched normal blood samples). Paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina ${versions.ILLUMINA_VERSION} technology. 
Reads were aligned using <a href=${versions.BWAMEM_LINK}>bwa mem</a> (${versions.BWAMEM_VERSION}) against
reference genome <a href=${versions.REFERENCE_GENOME_LINK}>${versions.REFERENCE_GENOME_VERSION}</a> and processed according to GATK best practices, 
including duplicate marking with <a href=${versions.PICARD_LINK}>Picard</a> (${versions.PICARD_VERSION}), 
realignment around small insertions and deletions (in/dels), and base recalibration with <a href=${versions.GATK_LINK}>GATK</a> (v.${versions.GATK_VERSION}). 
SNVs and in/dels were called using <a href=${versions.MUTECT2_LINK}>MuTect2</a> (GATK v.${versions.MUTECT2_VERSION}) 
and annotated with <a href=${versions.VARIANTEFFECTPREDICTOR_LINK}>VariantEffectPredictor</a> (v.${versions.VARIANTEFFECTPREDICTOR_VERSION}) 
using MANE transcripts (MANE Clinical version 1.0 when available, <a href=${versions.MANE_LINK}>MANE Select</a> version ${versions.MANE_VERSION} for all other transcripts).
Variants were further annotated for oncogenicity and actionability by <a href=${versions.ONCOKB_LINK}>OncoKB</a>. 
In cases where OncoKB does not use MANE Select, links in annotation use the corresponding alteration in OncoKB.
Copy number variations were called using <a href=${versions.SEQUENZA_LINK}>Sequenza</a> (${versions.SEQUENZA_VERSION}). 
Microsatellite (MS) Instability status is called using <a href=${versions.MICROSATELLITE_LINK}>msisensor-pro</a> (${versions.MICROSATELLITE_VERSION}) and a custom list of MS sites created by msisensor-pro for the current reference genome.
Hrdetect takes SNVs and In/Dels from mutect2. The proportion of deletions that are at microhomologous sites is summarized as "Microhomologous Deletions".
The counts of SNVs are categorized into exposures based on their trinucleotide context using 
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deconstructSigs/index.html">DeconstructSigs</a> (v. 1.8.0) and SBS signatures
as defined in <a href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/downloads/">COSMIC version 1</a>. 
HRDetect also takes in LOH and structural variants. Structural variants are first called by 
<a href="https://github.com/PapenfussLab/gridss">GRIDSS</a> (v.2.13.2)
and then passed to PURPLE (v.3.8.1) for integrated LOH calling. Structural variants are then categorized into exposures based on break-end 
characteristics using <a href="https://github.com/Nik-Zainal-Group/signature.tools.lib">signature.tools.lib</a> (v. 2.1.2) 
and the rearrangement signature set defined in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17676">Nik-Zainal et al. (2016)</a>.
