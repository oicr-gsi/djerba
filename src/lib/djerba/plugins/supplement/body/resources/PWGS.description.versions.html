  Plasma whole genome sequencing (pWGS) is a comprehensive next generation sequencing assay for the detection of minimal residual disease. 
  Plasma libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep kit with DNA extracted from cfDNA. 
  Paired-end sequencing was performed using the illumina ${versions.ILLUMINA_VERSION} technology. 
  Alignments were performed using <a href=${versions.BWAMEM_LINK}>bwa</a> mem (${versions.BWAMEM_VERSION}) 
  against reference genome <a href=${versions.REFERENCE_GENOME_LINK}>${versions.REFERENCE_GENOME_VERSION}</a> 
  and processed with <a href=${versions.PICARD_LINK}>Picard</a> (${versions.PICARD_VERSION}), which includes duplicate marking. 
  Reads were filtered for ctDNA likelihood and matches with primary tumour by <a href=${versions.MRDETECT_LINK}>MRDetect</a> (${versions.MRDETECT_VERSION}). 
  The sample is compared against a control cohort of Healthy Blood Controls (HBCs) sequenced and processed at OICR using the same procedure as any tested plasma sample.
