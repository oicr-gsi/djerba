  <strong>Callability: </strong>The percentage of bases above 30x in tumour sample. Callability above 75% is considered a pass.
  <br><strong>Coverage: </strong>Mean number of bases covering each sequenced base. 
  <br><strong>Estimated Cancer Cell Content (%): </strong>The inferred tumour purity as determined bioinformatically.
  <br><strong>Estimated Ploidy: </strong>The inferred tumour ploidy as determined bioinformatically. This value is not clinically validated.
