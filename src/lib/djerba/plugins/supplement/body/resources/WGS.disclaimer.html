<p>Based on a minimum tumour purity of 30%, the sensitivity for SNVs and in/dels is 96% and 89%, respectively. 
    The sensitivity for CNVs and RNA fusions is 86% and 32%, respectively. 
    The limit of detection is 10% VAF for SNVs and 20% for in/dels. The limit of detection for MSI is cellularity >50%. 
    For HRD, sensitivity is 83% and specificity of 90%. The lower limit of detection has not been determined.</p>
<p>This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by OICR Genomics. It has not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
