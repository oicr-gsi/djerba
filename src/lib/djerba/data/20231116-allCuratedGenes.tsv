ENST00000318560	NM_005157.4	ENST00000318560	NM_005157.4	25	ABL1	true	1	R1	ABL1, a tyrosine kinase, is frequently altered by chromosomal translocations in leukemia.	ABL1 (also ABL) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with ubiquitous cellular expression. ABL is located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus and can be activated by growth factor receptors, cellular kinases or DNA damage (PMID: 24421390, 1591775). In response to extrinsic ligand stimulation, ABL signaling regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (PMID: 7651539, 7512450). ABL has additional cellular roles including regulation of actin polymerization, vascular development, transcription, and T cell maturation (PMID: 24421390). In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), translocations between the ABL and BCR genes result in the driver fusion protein BCR-ABL (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein is a constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinase that causes ligand-independent activation of signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein results in loss of auto-inhibition of ABL leading to activation of the kinase (PMID: 8246975). Alternative ABL1 translocations are also observed in myeloid disease (PMID: 9695962). Small molecule inhibitors of BCR-ABL, imatinib and dasatinib, have been developed and are FDA-approved for CML and Ph+ALL (PMID:11870241, 21931113). Mutations in the ABL kinase domain lead to resistance to these treatments and determine sensitivity to other second-generation inhibitors (PMID: 15256671).	false	R1

ABL2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the ABL protein family (PMID: 26645050). ABL2 localizes to actin protrusions and mediates the formation and stabilization of actin filaments in coordination with cortactin (PMID: 30256707). Î²1 integrins signal via ABL2 pathways to control several cellular processes including neuronal stability, cell adhesion, cell migration, and invasion (PMID: 30256707, 25694433, 23365224). Phosphorylation of ABL2 by receptor tyrosine kinases and SRC family kinases results in ABL2 activation, autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of downstream signaling molecules, such as the transcription factor STAT3 (PMID: 21892207). ABL2 is localized in the cytoplasm and is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, resulting in enhanced cellular proliferation, invasion, and metabolic changes (PMID: 26645050). Recurrent ABL2 fusion proteins are found in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias and gangliogliomas (PMID: 29507076, 29880043, 25098428, 10706884). ABL2 fusions result in increased ABL2-mediated signaling, suggesting that ABL2 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 25207766). ABL-targeted small molecule kinase inhibitors may be efficacious in cancers with ABL2 positive rearrangements (PMID: 29464092, 19451690, 25207766).	false

The ABRAXAS1 is a DNA repair protein that mediates recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) for DNA damage checkpoint regulation and DNA damage repair through direct binding to BRCA1. The ABRAXAS1-BRCA1 complex plays an important role in tumor suppression. ABRAXAS1 copy loss and somatic mutations have been observed in multiple human cancers, including endometrial, colon, lung, liver, kidney cancers, and in leukemia, with the highest mutation rate found in endometrial cancer (2.5%) (PMID: 25066119). A novel germ line mutation in Abraxas which abrogates BRCA1-dependent DNA repair function has been identified and shown to increases familial breast cancer susceptibility (PMID: 22357538).	true	
ENST00000272928	NM_020311	ENST00000272928	NM_020311	57007	ACKR3	true			ACKR3, a chemokine receptor, is infrequently altered in cancer.	ACKR3, also known as CXCR7, encodes for the atypical chemokine scavenger receptor specific for stromal-derived factors CXCL12 and CXCL11 (PMID: 16107333, 16940167). The ACKR3-CXCL12 signaling axis promotes cancer cell survival, migration, adhesion, angiogenesis and metastasis from ERK activation through MAPK signaling (PMID: 16940167, 20018651). As a scavenger receptor, ACKR3 is responsible for creating a CXCL12 gradient and influences cell migration and weakens CXCR4 activity through ACKR-CXCL12 internalization (PMID: 18267076). The oncogenic and tumor suppressive role of ACKR3 is likely tissue-type specific. Overexpression and silencing of ACKR3 in breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines and mouse models demonstrate tumorigenesis and cell survival (PMID: 17898181). In contrast, ACKR3 activation in neuroblastoma and colon cancer cell lines demonstrates suppression of tumor growth, cell growth and migration (PMID: 22916293, 24255072). Amplification of ACKR3 has been identified in various cancers, including breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 27572688, 26912435). Downregulation of ACKR3 has been identified in undifferentiated neuroblastoma (PMID: 22916293). Loss of ACKR3 in non-small cell lung cancer cell models has demonstrated attenuation of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance through inhibition of the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway (PMID: 31273063).	true

ACTG1 is a cytoskeletal protein that is a member of the actin family (PMID: 24098136, 19497859, 6420066). Actin proteins comprise cellular filaments and can be classified into three groups: alpha, beta and gamma actin, with ACTG1 functioning as cytoplasmic gamma-actin (PMID: 24098136). ACTG1 is highly expressed in the cytoskeleton of diverse cell types, as well as in the Z-discs and costamere structures of adult striated muscles (PMID: 6420066). ACTG1 monomers are important for a variety of cellular functions including cell motility, muscle contraction, cell signaling, cell junction establishment and maintenance of cell shape (PMID: 24098136). ACTG1, along with ACTB, is highly expressed in dividing cells and is critical for adequate muscle function (PMID: 6420066). Germline mutations in ACTG1 have been identified in patients with hearing loss and in Baraiser-Winter Syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by short stature, ptosis and hearing loss (PMID: 13680526, 14684684, 22366783). Somatic ACTG1 mutations are relatively rare in human cancers; however, a SNP in ACTG1 is associated with extreme toxicity to vincristine, a therapy commonly used to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25084203). Overexpression of ACTG1 has also been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma with mechanisms related to altered glucose metabolism and cellular proliferation (PMID: 30881024, 30675230).	true	
ENST00000263640	NM_001111067.2	ENST00000263640	NM_001111067.2	90	ACVR1	true			ACVR1, a receptor protein, is mutated in various cancer types including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).	ACVR1 (activin receptor type 1), also known as ALK2, is a transmembrane protein with cytosolic serine/threonine kinase activity that participates in signaling of transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-B) superfamily members. It signals by binding to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and activins and forms a heteromeric complex with other receptors. This complex is composed of two type 1 receptors, which are essential for intracellular signaling, and two type 2 receptors, which are essential for ligand binding. Binding of the ligand to the type 2 receptor stabilizes the complex and results in phosphorylation of type 1 receptors, thus resulting in downstream signaling mediated by the SMAD family of proteins (PMID: 15621726). In normal tissues, signaling through ACVR1 regulates cell survival, differentiation and proliferation. Somatic gain-of-function mutations in ACVR1 are the basis of the autosomal dominant condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP), which results in heterotopic ossification in humans (PMID: 25337067), and similar mutations are present in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) (PMID: 24769718).	false

ACVR1B encodes for a serine/threonine kinase activin A type IB receptor that functions as a transducer for activin-like ligands that are growth and differentiation factors (PMID: 30335480). ACVR1B mediates TGF-Î² pathway activation through phosphorylation of the SMAD proteins (PMID: 15689496, 30335480). Knockdown of ACVR1B in pancreatic cancer cell lines and models induces cellular growth, tumorigenesis and dysregulated TGF-Î² signaling, suggesting that ACVR1B functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 11248065, 24886203). Inactivating mutations of ACVR1B have been identified in pancreatic cancer and ER-negative breast cancer (PMID: 24886203, 26408346, 8519692).	true	
ENST00000396623	NM_144650	ENST00000396623	NM_144650	137872	ADHFE1	true			ADHFE1, a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase, is infrequently altered in cancer.	ADHFE1 encodes the hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase enzyme which functions in the oxidation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate to succinic semialdehyde in mammalian tissue (PMID: 16616524). This oxidation reaction is coupled to the reduction of 2-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (PMID: 30250890). The promotion of reductive carboxylation by ADHFE1 supports increased acetyl-CoA synthesis and lipogenesis (PMID: 22106302). As ADHFE1 regulates multiple cellular functions, such as DNA replication and cell cycle control, depending on the tissue, its role in cancer has varied depending on cancer type (PMID: 34179501). MYC-induced overexpression of ADHFE1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes tumorigenesis through the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate and mitochondrial ROS, suggesting that ADHFE1 functions primarily as an oncogene in breast cancer (PMID: 29202474, 30250890). However, silencing of ADHFE1 in colorectal cancer patient-derived xenograft mice models and colorectal cancer cell lines increases tumor growth and cell proliferation (PMID: 31632063). Hypermethylation of ADHFE1 has been identified in various different types of cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 34179501).	false	
ENST00000265343	NM_014423	ENST00000265343	NM_014423	27125	AFF4	true			AFF4, a scaffolding protein involved in transcriptional regulation, is infrequently altered in cancer.	"AFF4 (AF4/FMR2 family member 4 ) is a scaffolding protein that helps assemble and is a core component of the transcription super elongation complex (SEC) (PMID: 31147444, PMID: 22895430). The SEC functions to remove RNA polymerase II from proximal-promoter pausing, thus regulating the rapid induction of gene transcription. AFF4 has also been shown to play a role in the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 viral genes (PMID: 28134250, PMID: 26007649). AFF4 has many direct transcriptional targets such as MYC and JUN, and has been linked to transcriptional upregulation of TMEM100, ZNF711, and FAM13C, among others (PMID: 25730767). Germline gain-of-function mutations in the highly conserved fourteen amino acid ALF (AF4/LAF4/FMR2) homology domain of AFF4 underlie the germline syndrome CHOPS (C-cognitive impairment and coarse facies; H-heart defects; O-obesity; P-pulmonary involvement; S-short stature and skeletal dysplasia)(PMID: 25730767, PMID: 31058441). AF4-domain-mutation of the AFF4 gene specifically in Purkinje cells in the brain was identified as the cause of neurodegeneration in a ""robotic mouse"" model that developed early-onset de novo ataxia and cataracts (PMID: 12629167). In cancer, alterations of the SEC can allow unregulated transcriptional elongation and lead to tumorigenesis. AFF4-KMT2A (MLL) fusions have been identified in pediatric acute leukemia, whereby the AF4 domain of AFF4 interacts with selectivity factor 1 (SL1) on chromatin to load TATA-binding protein (TBP) onto the promoter to initiate RNA polymerase II-dependent and constitutive transcription (PMID: 28701730, PMID: 27865805, PMID: 26593443). Overexpression of AFF4 has been observed in human head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) (PMID: 29741610) and melanoma (PMID: 33417923). In preclinical models, AFF4 overexpression enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion of HNSCC and melanoma cells through SOX-2 and c-Jun, which could be reversed with AFF4 depletion via siRNA. In bladder cancer cell line models, METTL3, an important RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase, was found to be overexpressed resulting in m6A modification of AFF4, leading to enhanced promoter binding and transcription of MYC (PMID: 30659266)."	false

AGO1 (also Argonaute-1) is an RNA silencing protein that is a member of the Argonaute family (PMID: 15105377, 23746446). AGO1 regulates RNA-mediated gene silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi) (PMID: 15105377, 23746446). Argonaute proteins are an essential component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is guided to mRNA targets by mircoRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (PMID: 19239886, 23654304, 17928262). Upon single-stranded RNA-mediated complementarity-based recognition of mRNAs, AGO1 inhibits translation of the mRNA target (PMID: 22231398). In addition, AGO1 has diverse roles in the regulation of small RNA processing including translation repression, regulation of miRNA maturation and heterochromatin formation (PMID: 22961379, 22231398). AGO1 is altered by overexpression in various cancers, such as in colorectal and hepatocellular cancer (PMID: 29487329, 20146808). Somatic mutations in AGO1 have been identified, however, have not been functionally characterized. Loss of AGO1 in hepatocellular cancer cell lines resulted in decreased proliferation and invasion, suggesting that AGO1 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 29487329, 24086155).	false

Upon single-stranded RNA-mediated, complementarity-based recognition of mRNAs, AGO2 either cleaves or inhibits translation of its targets (PMID: 19239886, 23654304). In addition, AGO2 has diverse roles in the regulation of small RNA processing including translation repression, regulation of miRNA maturation and heterochromatin formation (PMID: 26284139). Oncogenic proteins, such as mutant KRAS, can also complex with AGO2 to mediate gene silencing (PMID: 26854235). AGO2 is altered by amplification and overexpression in various cancers, such as ovarian, breast and prostate (PMID: 20146808, 24427355). In contrast, AGO2 protein levels are depleted in some melanoma tumor samples (PMID: 24169347).

AJUBA is a scaffolding protein that is a member of the Zynzin/Ajuba LIM-domain containing protein family (PMID: 31740385, 15520811). AJUBA is a promiscuous protein that can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm to mediate protein-protein interactions (PMID: 15520811, 17909014). Binding of AJUBA modulates the activity of many protein complexes involved in regulating diverse cellular processes including cellular adhesion, tension sensing, cellular motility, mitosis and microRNA processing, among others (PMID: 31740385, 12417594, 13678582, 20616046, 17621269). In addition, AJUBA is an important mediator of many signaling pathways including WNT, MAPK and Hippo pathways (PMID: 31740385, 24336325). For example, AJUBA interacts with LATS2, an important kinase in the Hippo pathway, to mediate downstream signaling (PMID: 24336325). In addition, AJUBA functions as a transcriptional co-repressor that interacts with SLUG domain proteins (involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition), nuclear hormone receptors and SP1 (PMID: 17909014, 20133701). Reduced activity of AJUBA in cancer-derived cell lines results in enhanced proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and increased growth in murine xenografts (PMID: 30006462, 24336325), suggesting that AJUBA predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor. However, AJUBA expression has also been found to be an indicator of poor prognosis and cancer progression in several tumor types (PMID: 27172796, 29299158, 30597111, 28422308). Somatic mutations in AJUBA are found in various cancer types including head and neck, orpharyngeal, esophageal squamous cancer, among others (PMID: 25631445, 30046007, 29127303, 25839328, 25303977).

AKT1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a critical downstream effector in the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signaling pathway. Following activation of PI3K, cytosolic inactive AKT1 is recruited to the membrane and engages PIP3 (PtdIns3,4,5-P3), leading to phosphorylation and activation of AKT1 (PMID: 28431241). AKT1 can activate a number of downstream substrates, including GSK3, FOXO and mTORC1, which are critical for cellular survival, proliferation, and metabolism (PMID: 9843996, 7611497). Negative regulation of AKT1 occurs when PI3K signaling is terminated by PTEN phosphatase activity (PMID: 28431241). AKT1 is frequently activated in cancers, typically through activation of the PI3K pathway or by inactivation of PTEN (PMID: 28431241). Activating mutations in AKT1 (PMID: 17611497, 23134728, 20440266) and infrequent AKT1 gene amplification (PMID: 18767981) have been identified in human cancers, which allow for phosphoinositide-independent AKT1 activation. The ATP-competitive AKT1 inhibitor AZD5363 has demonstrated activity in patients with AKT1-mutant cancers (PMID: 28489509). Negative feedback mechanisms can mediate AKT-inhibitor resistance in human cancers with dysregulated AKT signaling (PMID: 29535262, 29339542).	false

The AKT2 protein is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a critical downstream effector in the PI3K signaling pathway. AKT2, along with closely related AKT1 and AKT3, are members of the AGC kinase family. Effects of AKT activation include cell cycle progression and increased migration, differentiation and glucose homeostasis (PMID: 12094235). AKT2 activation occurs when its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) dislodges from the kinase domain (KD), localizes to the cell membrane, and several of its key residues become phosphorylated (PMID: 9374542). AKT2 is an oncogene that is activated in numerous cancers, mostly through amplification of the 19q13.1-q13.2 chromosomal region (PMID: 1409633, 9496907) or overexpression (PMID: 11756242), which promote invasion and metastasis (PMID: 12517798). Germline autosomal dominant mutations in AKT2 are associated with familial diabetes mellitus in humans (PMID: 15166380).

ALB (also serum albumin) is the most abundant protein in blood plasma and composes half of human serum (PMID: 30097614, 25161624). ALB is produced in the liver as the precursor prealbumin before transport to relevant sites for processing (PMID: 2503514). The main function of ALB is to serve as a carrier for proteins that arenât soluble, including hormones, fatty acids, metals, toxins and bilirubin, among others (PMID: 26055641). In addition, ALB associates with drugs, which can either positively or negatively impact their activity (PMID: 26055641, 25161624, 31704999). Paciltaxel, a breast cancer therapy, is an example of a drug that can be pre-loaded onto albumin prior to injection in an effort to improve drug efficacy (PMID: 25161624). Receptor-mediated endocytosis of ALB is a mechanism of nutrient scavenging in rapidly proliferating cancer cells  (PMID: 30097614, 26055641). ALB is then bound by the internal scavenging receptors gp30 and gp18, which break ALB into amino acids and fatty acids (PMID: 8463286). The Fc receptor is an important regulator of endocytic recycling of ALB; downregulation of this receptor is found in cancer (PMID: 27384673). Patients with various malignancies, including cancer, may experience hypoalbuminemia (low albumin) and hyperalbuminemia (high albumin) (PMID: 27612919). Serum albumin levels can be utilized as prognostic markers in several cancer types, with hypoalbuminemia predominantly a predictor of poor outcome (PMID: 28838406, 29183294,31531785). Variants in albumin have been identified; however, the exact function of these alterations is unclear (PMID: 23558059).	false

ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the insulin receptor family (PMID: 24060861). Ligand binding to ALK results in activation of downstream signaling including the JAK-STAT, RAS-MAPK, PI3K-mTOR and JUN pathways (PMID: 24060861, 24715763). ALK signaling plays an important role in nervous system development (PMID: 9053841) as well as regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and transformation (PMID: 19737948). ALK translocations are common in cancer and predominantly result in the constitutive activation of ALK kinase activity. The nucleophosmin (NPM1)-ALK fusion protein is found in 60% of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs) (PMID: 9736036) while the EML4-ALK fusion protein is found in 3-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (PMID: 25079552). Additional ALK translocations have been found in a variety of tumor types including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (PMID: 24060861). ALK is found overexpressed or somatically mutated in multiple cancers, and secondary mutations in ALK are common after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (PMID: 24060861). The ALK kinase inhibitors crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib have been FDA-approved for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 27413075, 25754348, 25170012).	false	R2

ALOX12B (also 12R-LOX) is a lipoxygenase that is a member of the LOX protein family (PMID: 24021977). 12R-LOX, the enzyme encoded by the gene ALOX12B, mediates fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the addition of an oxygen molecule to arachidonic acid, generating the molecule 12R-HPETE (PMID: 24021977). 12R-LOX is active primarily in the skin and other epithelial tissues (PMID: 9618483, 10100631, 10446122) and plays an important role in the establishment of the epidermal barrier function (PMID: 17403930, 21558561). Another LOX family member, eLOX3, is required for the downstream synthesis of hepoxilins after 12R-HPETE generation; these play key roles in epithelial permeability and signaling (PMID: 15629692, 24021977, 19558494). ALOX12B also mediates immunosuppressive activity by decreasing antigen presentation on T cells (PMID: 22503541). Inactivating mutations in ALOX12B have been observed in autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by dried, scaling skin (PMID: 11773004, 16116617, 15629692, 19131948, 17139268). Somatic missense, nonsense mutations and deletions of ALOX12B are found in a wide range of cancers, including melanoma and other skin cancers; however, these alterations have yet to be functionally validated (cBioPortal, MSKCC, April 2020). Amplification of ALOX12B in breast and ovarian cancer has been associated with reduced cytolytic activity by the immune system (PMID: 25594174). In addition, ALOX12B is activated in cancer cells treated with therapies that induce arachidonic acid via a p53-dependent mechanism (PMID: 30258081).	true

AMER1 (APC membrane recruitment 1) is an APC-binding protein that regulates the cellular localization of the APC tumor suppressor, thereby regulating APC-dependent cellular morphogenesis, cell migration and cell-cell adhesion (PMID: 17925383, 20843316, 27462415). AMER1 also functions as a negative regulator of WNT/Î²-catenin signaling (PMID: 21248786, 17510365, 20843316). In this capacity, AMER1 acts as a scaffold protein by assembling Î²-catenin and members of the destruction complex at the plasma membrane, which is necessary for Î²-catenin degradation (PMID: 17510365, 21498506). The AMER1 gene is mutated in approximately 5-10% of Wilms tumors, a pediatric kidney cancer (PMID: 17204608, 21248786, 19137020, 18311776, 26274016). Missense and truncating AMER1 mutations are found in approximately 7-10% of colorectal cancers and correlate with reduced WNT signaling (PMID: 26071483). This data is consistent with AMER1 functioning as a tumor suppressor, as loss of AMER1 results in activation of WNT/ Î²-catenin signaling (PMID: 17510365, 17510365).	true

ANKRD11 is an ankyrin repeat domain protein that binds and suppresses the function of the p160 coactivator family (PMID: 15184363), thereby inhibiting ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. ANKRD11 is also a coactivator of the p53 tumor suppressor (PMID: 18840648), thereby influencing many pathways relevant to cancer, including transcriptional initiation, cell cycle regulation, ion transport and Notch signaling. Studies in murine and human neural precursors demonstrate that ANKRD11 can function as a chromatin regulator that binds histone deacetylases and alters gene expression (PMID: 25556659). Heterozygous mutations in ANKRD11 have been reported to cause KBG syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and macrodontia (PMID: 21782149). ANKRD11 is hypermethylated in breast cancer leading to decreased transcriptional activity, suggesting that ANKRD11 functions as a putative tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 22538187).	true	
ENST00000257430	NM_000038.5	ENST00000257430	NM_000038.5	324	APC	false			APC, a tumor suppressor involved in WNT signaling, is recurrently altered in colorectal cancer.	APC is a negative regulator of the pro-oncogenic WNT/ Î²-catenin signaling pathway (PMID: 8259518, 8259519). The main tumor suppressive role of APC is to modulate intracellular levels of Î²-catenin (PMID: 11978510). APC is an essential member of the destruction complex, which targets cytosolic Î²-catenin for ubiquitination and degradation (PMID: 10984057). When the activity of APC is lost, there is an aberrant increase in WNT-pathway activation, often leading to hyperplasia and eventually tumor progression (PMID: 8259511). A threshold of APC expression is required to suppress tumor formation, and this level is finely balanced (PMID: 11743581). Germline mutations in the APC gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (PMID: 1651174, 1651562), a disease in which 95% of people progress to develop colorectal cancer (PMID: 1528264). In addition, heritable mutations in APC are responsible for the development of a number of related diseases, including Turcot Syndrome, Gardner Syndrome and Flat Adenoma Syndrome (FAS) (PMID: 8593545). APC mutations, much like those seen in FAS, have been observed in 50-80% of sporadic colorectal cancers (PMID: 17143297). Somatic mutations in APC function as tumor-initiating events and are also observed in a number of other human cancers including breast, stomach, and prostate (PMID: 27302369, 29316426). The majority of APC mutations are loss-of-function and occur in a region important for Î²-catenin binding (PMID: 10784639, 1338904). Inhibitors of the WNT pathway are currently in clinical development (PMID: 24981364).	true

APLNR (also AGTRL1) is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) protein family (PMID: 28783722). GPCR proteins can bind ligands, which initiate a conformational change allowing the receptor to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and exchange GDP for GTP on an associated G protein (PMID: 28091541). APLNR binds the hormones APELA and APLN to activate downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades (PMID: 17412318). APLNR has diverse cellular functions including the regulation of cardiac function, blood vessel formation, proliferation, hypoxia and apoptosis, among others (PMID: 27083318, 17412318, 15530405, 29807055, 27825851, 30718358). In addition, APLNR interacts with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase JAK1 to initiate IFNÎ³-mediated downstream signaling and to mediate antigen presentation to the immune system (PMID: 28783722). Loss-of-function mutations in APLNR have been identified in patients with melanoma and lung cancer who exhibit resistance to T-cell based immunotherapies, such as ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab (PMID: 28783722). However, APLNR is also found to be overexpressed in some cancer types and ALPNR-mediated signaling promotes angiogenesis, suggesting that APLNR may have context-specific roles in cancer progression (PMID: 27083318, 30783205, 30718358, 31267692).	true	
ENST00000374690	NM_000044.3	ENST00000374690	NM_000044.3	367	AR	true			AR (androgen receptor), a transcription factor, is most frequently altered in advanced or castration-resistant prostate cancer.	AR (androgen receptor) is a nuclear receptor that is activated following binding of androgenic hormones (PMID: 1865110, 8809738). The AR protein acts as a steroid-hormone activated transcription factor that regulates gene transcription. In the absence of androgen, AR is predominantly maintained in an inactive conformation in the cytoplasm (PMID: 9175625, 12269826). Upon androgen binding, AR undergoes an activating conformational change that allows for its translocation into the nucleus, homodimerization and binding to DNA at sites with androgen response elements (ARE) motifs (PMID: 9175625, 12000757, 11376111, 8360187). In concert with accessory coactivators and corepressors, AR serves to activate or repress the transcription of AR-mediated target genes (PMID: 11931767, 17679089). Germline loss-of-function mutations in AR cause genetic XY males and rodents to develop as external phenotypic females, also lacking internal sexual secondary organs (PMID: 4402348, 2341409, 2041777, 3186717, 2594783). AR signaling is important in prostate cancers, particularly in tumors that become resistant to androgen deprivation therapies, termed castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). AR is frequently altered in CRPCs resulting in continued activation despite a castrate level of androgen (PMID: 26566796). Mutations in AR can lead to clinical resistance to antiandrogen therapy in CRPC (PMID: 23580326).	false

ARAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase and signaling component in the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase signaling pathway. ARAF is a member of the RAF kinase family, which also includes BRAF and CRAF (PMID: 17555829). ARAF is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest physiological levels found in the urogenital organs (PMID: 10768864). Upon activation by RAS proteins, ARAF forms dimers with BRAF and CRAF, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of the downstream signaling effectors MEK and subsequently ERK. Activation of the RAS signaling cascade ultimately leads to increased cell growth and proliferation (PMID: 21779496). ARAF activating mutations are found at low frequencies in cholangiocarcinomas, lung, uterine and histiocytic carcinomas (PMID: 25608663, 26566875). The most common oncogenic ARAF mutation impairs a phosphorylation site that negatively regulates RAS binding and ARAF activation, leading to hyperactivity of the MAP-kinase signaling pathway (PMID: 24569458). ARAF-mutant cancers may be sensitive to RAF and MAPK family inhibitors, such as sorafenib (PMID: 24569458).	false

ARHGAP35 (also GRLF1) is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the activity of Rho-family small GTPases (guanosine triphosphatases) (PMID: 31013840). Rho GTPases modulate actin-mediated cellular functions including cellular adhesion, migration and cell division (PMID: 31013840, 12606561). ARHGAP35 encodes the protein p190A which, along with the paralog p190B, function as the main GAP proteins that regulate Rho cellular activity (PMID: 8537347). GAP proteins, such as p190A, enhance nucleotide hydrolysis and inhibit GTPase signaling activity (PMID: 27628050). p190A interacts with a variety of effector molecules, including RHOA, RHOC and RAC1, among others, to regulate cell adhesion and migration (PMID: 28287334, 27646271). In addition, p190A associates with TFII-I and eIF3A to mediate gene expression and translation, respectively (PMID: 28007963, 15629714). p190A is also implicated in several other cellular processes including entosis, dendritic spine formation and endothelial permeability (PMID: 18045538, 18267090, 17562701). Somatic mutations in ARHGAP35 have been identified in a variety of tumor types in pan-cancer studies, most predominantly in uterine carcinomas (PMID: 24132290, 24390350). ARHGAP35 mutations have also been associated with HÃ¼rthle cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer and renal angiomyolipoma (PMID: 30107175, 28176259, 27494029). These alterations commonly occur as nonsense or frameshift mutations throughout the ARHGAP35 gene (PMID: 31013840, 27646271). However, disruption of p190A in functional assays has both growth inhibitory and proliferative effects, suggesting that p190A may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the context (PMID: 31013840, 27646271).	true

ARHGEF12, or leukemia-associated RhoGEF, encodes a protein of the diffuse B-cell lymphoma (Dbl) family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activates small GTPase Rho (PMID: 23255595). ARHGEF12 has been implicated in regulating various cellular pathways including cell morphology and polarization, invasion, the final steps of cytokinesis and integrin force regulation (PMID: 23885121, 33419897, 21572419). ARHGEF12 is implicated in an oncogenic positive feedback loop with RhoA-effector DIAPH1 and RhoA in the LPA-stimulated Rho/ROCK signaling pathway, promoting bleb-associated cancer cell invasion and tumor cell morphology (PMID: 17575049). Loss of ARHGEF12 has been identified in breast cancer and colorectal cancer (PMID: 19734946). Rare chromosomal rearrangements of ARHGEF12 have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and have been suggested to lead to loss of ARHGEF12 function to promote tumorigenesis (PMID: 33419897, 34237703, 19734946).	true

ARHGEF28 (also Rgnef and p190RhoGEF) is a Rho guanine exchange factor (GEF) that catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP (PMID: 24467206, 24006257). ARHGEF28 activates small RhoA GTPases by catalyzing the dissociation of GDP and facilitating a conformational change leading to GTP binding. ARHGEF28 activity is required for focal adhesion establishment, regulation of cell motility, contractility, and initiation of cell signaling (PMID: 24467206). ARHGEF28 binds and functions as either a GEF or a scaffolding protein to initiate FAK activation and cell contractility (PMID: 24467206, 24006257). Functional studies have demonstrated that the RhoA-FAK pathway is important for cancer cell proliferation and migration in breast and lung cancer models (PMID: 19147981, 23358651, 21224360).

ARID5A binds the 3âUTR of IL-6 mRNA (PMID: 23676272) and regulates IL-6 mRNA stability in response to cytokine stimulation (PMID: 23676272). ARID5A expression is increased in macrophages and T-cells in response to LPS, IL-1Î², and IL-6 treatment (PMID: 23676272). IL-6 induces the expression of ARID5A in T-cells leading to differentiation into inflammatory T-cells (such as Th17 cells) via a STAT3 dependent mechanism (PMID: 24782182, 27022145). Loss of ARID5A in murine hematopoietic and lung tissues results in a reduction of STAT3 and IL-6 expression and a blunting of the immune response, suggesting that ARID5A plays a critical role in inflammation, T-cell differentiation and autoimmunity (PMID: 27022145, 28379390). IL-6 stability is also important for the regulation of key cell signaling pathways including the NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways (PMID: 28168301). In addition, ARID5A has been implicated in RNA binding to other T-cell-related mRNAs, including T-bet, and DNA binding in collaboration with Sox9 in chondrocytes (PMID: 21346191).

ARID5B is a binding partner of the demethylase PHF2 (PMID: 21532585); the ARID5B-PHF2 complex binds to the promoters of SOX9 target genes to transcriptionally activate chondrogenesis (PMID: 24276541). ARID5B polymorphisms confer increased risk of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as determined by genome-wide association studies (PMID: 19684604, 19684603). It was further determined that these patients show significant association with the clinical phenotype of intracellular accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamates, which is consistent with greater sensitivity to methotrexate-based chemotherapies (PMID: 19710713).

ASXL1 interacts directly with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and has a role in the recruitment of PRC2 to chromatin and subsequent H3K27me3 histone modifications (PMID: 22897849). Mutations in ASXL1 result in the inability of Polycomb target genes to be effectively repressed leading to dysregulated gene expression, such as at the HOXA gene cluster (PMID: 22897849). ASXL1 also independently interacts with the chromatin protein BAP1 (PMID: 22878500). The BAP1-ASXL1 complex can regulate the H2AK119 ubiquitin mark placed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) (PMID: 20436459). Germline heterozygous mutations in ASXL1 have been found in patients with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a developmental disorder that results in distinctive craniofacial abnormalities (PMID: 21706002). Recurrent somatic ASXL1 loss-of-function mutations are very common in hematopoietic malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelofibrosis (MF), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 23147254, 30651633).

ATM is a member of the protein superfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related serine/threonine kinases (PIKKs). ATM functions as a tumor suppressor that initiates DNA damage checkpoint signaling after accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or after accumulation of other forms of cellular stress (PMID: 23219553). Activated ATM can phosphorylate hundreds of substrates in order to initiate and amplify the DNA damage response (PMID: 17525332) resulting in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Germline loss-of-function mutations in ATM have been identified in the autosomal recessive disorder Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a disorder that presents with a variety of neurologic conditions, lung and skin disorders and immunodeficiency (PMID: 21792198). Patients with A-T are also predisposed to a wide variety of cancers, particularly childhood lymphomas and leukemia as well as breast cancer (PMID: 21792198). Somatic mutations in ATM have been identified in lymphoid malignancies and a selection of solid tumors (PMID: 12400598, 27413114).

ATP1A1 binds ATP on its ATP-binding sites for the NKA complex's energy conversion to allow the transport of sodium and potassium ions across the cellular membrane (PMID: 34251542). Normal expression of ATP1A1 is dependent on different tissue types as lower and higher expression levels have been identified in various tissues. Selective inhibition of ATP1A1 in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines impairs cell proliferation and migration whereas overexpression of ATP1A1 in renal cancer cell lines impairs cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that ATP1A1 functions as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor depending on the tumor type (ââPMID: 17471453, 28484360).

ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) is a chromatin regulator that functions as a member of the SWI/SNF helicase family (PMID: 20110566, 17609377). ATRX is involved in the incorporation of histone H3.3 during telomere replication (PMID: 20110566). Loss of ATRX activity results in aberrant DNA methylation, histone composition and transcription, suggesting that ATRX functions predominantly as an epigenetic regulator (PMID: 29535300). Germline mutations in ATRX result in a severe form of X-linked mental retardation often associated with alpha-thalassemia (ATRX) syndrome (PMID: 8968741). Loss-of-function mutations or reduced ATRX expression is strongly correlated with an alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype in tumors (PMID: 21719641).

ATXN7 (also SCA7) is a chromatin-modifying protein that functions as a transcriptional co-activator (PMID: 16494529). ATXN7 is a component of the multi-subunit SAGA transcriptional complex that has multiple enzymatic functions including histone acetylation (PMID: 21746879) and deubiquitination (PMID: 21746879). The SAGA complex facilitates transcriptional regulation by remodeling chromatin via GCN5-mediated histone acetylation to promote general transcription factor binding to DNA (PMID: 21746879). In addition, the SAGA complex mediates targeting of the transcriptional pre-initiation complex to promoters and deubiquitination via the cofactors ATXN7L3, USP22, and ENY2 to mediate protein translation (PMID: 18206972). SAGA-dependent histone H2B deubiquitination is also critical for the DNA damage response, an activity that is especially important during class switch recombination (PMID: 21746879, 18206972). Trinucleotide repeat expansions in the coding region of the ATXN7 gene are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurological disorder that results in macular dystrophy and progressive retinal degeneration (PMID: 9288099, 9781533, 10330346, 10640674, 3062533). In SCA7-mutant murine models and in patients with SCA7, CAG trinucleotide expansions in ATXN7 result in an abnormal polyglutamine tract (polyQ) and in nuclear accumulation of protein (PMID: 14985428). Somatic mutations in ATXN7 are found in patients with thyroid cancer and cluster predominantly in the polyglutamine domain of the protein where the germline expansions occur in SCA7 (PMID: 28584132).

AXL is a receptor tyrosine kinase (PMID: 28072762) whose primary ligand is the vitamin K-dependent growth factor GAS6 (growth arrest-specific protein 6). Activation of AXL via GAS6 requires an additional interaction with phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid that is only accessible to apoptotic cells (PMID: 28072762). AXL activates the JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (PMID: 18620092) leading to proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance in AXL-expressing cells (PMID: 23982172). Additionally, AXL has been shown to be essential for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and can mediate metastasis in cancer (PMID: 16585512). While somatic mutations in AXL are rare, AXL is overexpressed in many human cancers including lung, breast, pancreatic and hematopoietic cancers (PMID: 1656220). AXL overexpression has been implicated in resistance to chemotherapy and targeted agents and decreased immune response, making AXL a target for drug development (PMID: 28072762). Currently, inhibitors specifically targeting AXL or multi-targeted kinase inhibitors with good potency against AXL are under clinical development (PMID: 25337673).	false

B2M (beta2-microglobulin) is a component of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule that is expressed by all nucleated cells (PMID: 8717519). Specifically, B2M serves as the light chain of the MHC class I molecule, which functions to present peptides derived from cellular proteins to CD8+ T lymphocytes, a process critical to adaptive immune responses (PMID: 8717519). Deletion of B2M in mice results in loss of MHC class I presentation and all CD8+ T cells (PMID: 2112266). Somatic B2M loss-of-function mutations have been identified in colorectal cancer and melanoma and are predicted to result in immune evasion (PMID: 22833104). Additionally, serum levels of free, soluble B2M are increased in many hematological and solid malignancies. Various non-immunologic context-dependent functions have been ascribed to soluble B2M; these include serving as a mitogenic or pro-apoptotic paracrine factor in various tumor types (PMID: 23848204, 19056512). Elevated serum B2M is a strong prognostic indicator of poor outcomes in many hematological malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, although the precise mechanism underlying this correlation is not fully understood (PMID: 8507875, 15809451, 8471438).	true	
ENST00000297574		ENST00000297574		79870	BAALC	true			BAALC, a cytoplasmic protein, is frequently overexpressed in cancer.	BAALC is a highly conserved mammalian cytoplasmic protein expressed in the central nervous system and in human hematopoietic cells (PMID: 11707601). BAALC is suggested to play a role in the hematopoietic system due to its expression in early progenitor cells, however, the function of BAALC is still largely unknown (PMID: 11707601, 33968759, 26171200). Overexpression of BAALC promotes tumorigenesis through the downregulation of apoptosis and upregulation of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and anchorage-dependent growth (PMID: 33968759, 22549446). BAALC overexpression has been identified in a variety of tumor types including cytogenetically normal-acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 11707601, 20535151). BAALC is used as a prognostic marker for survival outcome, as high BAALC expression has been correlated with poor prognosis in patients with AML (PMID: 21869843, 26171200).	false

BABAM1 (also MERIT40 or NBA1) is a component of both the BRCA1-A (breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein) and BRISC (BRCC36 isopeptidase) multiprotein complexes (PMID: 22974638, 28009280). The BRCA1-A complex recognizes ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites, facilitating damage-dependent BRCA1 localization and DNA repair (PMID: 19261748). BABAM1 has been implicated in the earliest stages of DNA interstrand cross-links repair (PMID: 26338419). The BRISC complex cleaves lysine 63 ubiquitinated substrates, playing a role in interferon responses and proper mitotic spindle assembly (PMID: 24075985, 26195665). Germline variants of BABAM1 have been reported to confer susceptibility to ovarian cancer (PMID: 20852633); however, somatic BABAM1 mutations appear to be rare in human cancers.	false

BACH2 is a transcription factor that functions predominantly as a transcriptional repressor and mediates innate and adaptive immunity (PMID: 29625895). BACH2 is an important regulator of terminal differentiation in both B and T cells (PMID: 29669243, 29625895). In B cells, BACH2 activity is required for the formation of germinal centers, somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, plasma cell lineage commitment, negative selection of pre-B cells and class switch recombination (PMID: 29540581, 29129929, 23852341). In T cells, BACH2 expression is required for memory cell activity and BACH2 downregulation is required for effector cells to appropriately differentiate (PMID: 29669243, 29625895, 28855027). In addition, BACH2 regulates the expression of KLRG1 on the surface of CD8+ T cells in order to initiate their entry into the effector or memory pool (PMID: 29669243, 29625895). Expression of BACH2 is also required to maintain the function of alveolar macrophages in the airway and to regulate the inflammatory response (PMID: 28993481). BACH2 represses the expression of several gene programs associated with immune cell differentiation programs, cell cycle, and cytokine production (PMID: 23728300, 29540581, 29529253). The activity of BACH2 is mediated by several upstream signaling pathways, including the ERK/MAPK and mTOR pathways (PMID: 29529253, 29129929, 28993481). BACH2 also competes with BCL6 DNA binding to activate TP53-mediated checkpoint control and tumor suppression (PMID: 23852341). Germline loss-of-function mutations and polymorphisms in BACH2 are associated with autoimmune and allergic disorders such as Crohnâs disease and asthma (PMID: 28530713, 23728300). Heterozygous loss of BACH2 leads to lymphocytic defects due to transcriptional and epigenetic dysfunction (PMID: 28530713), consistent with BACH2 functioning as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Somatic mutations in BACH2 are rare; however, reduced expression or promoter somatic hypermutation of BACH2 has been identified in mantle cell lymphomas and are implicated in drug resistance (PMID: 28592433).	true

Germline mutations of BAP1 predispose to various cancer types, including malignant mesothelioma, uveal and cutaneous melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma.	BAP1 (BRCA-associated Protein-1) is a nuclear ubiquitin hydrolase that has been implicated in several cellular processes including cell proliferation, DNA repair, chromatin regulation of gene expression, and stem cell pluripotency (PMID: 19815555, 20805357, 18757409). By deubiquitinating host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), a chromatin-associated protein that helps regulate transcription, BAP1 regulates cell proliferation (PMID: 19815555). BAP1 has been shown to regulate gene expression by forming a ternary complex with HCF-1 and the YY1 transcription factor (PMID: 20805357) and to enhance cell death by increasing progression through the G1-S checkpoint (PMID: 18757409). BAP1 loss alters class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression, which may result in altered therapeutic response to HDAC inhibitors in BAP1-depleted cancer cells (PMID: 25970771). Germline mutations of BAP1 predispose to several tumors including renal cell carcinoma, uveal melanoma and mesothelioma, which suggests that BAP1 is a tumor suppressor (PMID:23277170, 21874000, 23849051). Somatic BAP1 mutations are also common in these tumor types, among others (PMID: 23867514, 21642991, 23277170).	true

BARD1 is an adaptor protein that functions as an E3 ligase when in complex with BRCA1 (PMID: 8944023, 32094664, 11573085). BRCA1 is a well-characterized tumor suppressor that functions to maintain genome integrity by repairing DNA double-stranded breaks through homologous recombination and cell-cycle checkpoint activation (PMID: 20029420, 11278247). The BARD1-BRCA1 complex is involved in diverse cellular processes including various stages of DNA repair, gene expression, replication fork maintenance and chromatin regulation (PMID: 32094664, 28976962, 17873885, 29367421, 27239795). BARD1 interacts with BRCA1, binds DNA lesions on newly replicated DNA, and adds ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues on histone H2A (PMID: 32094664, 30804502). The BARD1-BRCA1 complex then mediates the resection of DNA lesions, evicts the antagonistic repair protein 53BP1, and recruits several DNA response proteins to damaged sites, including RAD51 (PMID: 32094664, 28976962, 12832489, 27239795). Poly ADP-ribose (PAR) mediates early recruitment of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex to damaged DNA sites (PMID: 25634209). Loss of BARD1 expression in murine models of breast cancer results in similar phenotypes as BRCA1 deletion, underscoring the likelihood that they function similarly (PMID: 18443292). Germline mutations in BARD1 predispose to familial breast and ovarian cancer, among other hereditary cancers (PMID: 11807980, 20077502, 16741161, 25058500). Some BARD1 variants function as dominant-negative mutations, suggesting that BARD1 predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 22350409). Somatic mutations in BARD1 are also found in human cancers and emerging data suggest that BARD1 can function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in different cellular contexts (PMID: 18089818, 29292755, 26738429).	true

BBC3 (BCL2 binding component 3, also known as PUMA) is a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein. BBC3 contains a BH3 (BCL-2 homology 3) domain, which allows for binding to anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, including BCL-xL and BCL-2 (PMID: 23175245). This binding releases the pro-apoptotic factors BAK and BAX, which in turn initiate apoptosis via permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane (PMID: 11463392, 17322918). BBC3 is a transcriptional target of TP53, but is also activated independently of TP53 in response to cellular stress; thus, BBC3 is considered both a p53-dependent and -independent pro-apoptotic factor (PMID: 14585359, 19641508). Although methylation-dependent silencing of BBC3 has been described in Burkitt lymphomas, somatic mutation of BBC3 is not commonly found in human cancers (PMID: 17267315, 18573879). However, BBC3 function can be altered as a consequence of perturbations of other factors in the apoptosis pathways, such as mutations in TP53, which abrogate the ability of TP53 to induce BBC3 expression (PMID: 21478674). BBC3 is a highly efficient effector of apoptosis, and BH3 mimetic peptides and small molecule therapeutics targeting anti-apoptotic proteins are being investigated as therapeutic options in cancers with dysregulated BBC3 activity (PMID: 17921043, 11463391, 19641508).	true

BCL10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10) is an adaptor protein involved in apoptosis and NF-kB signaling. The protein forms part of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is a regulator of NFkB signaling in lymphocytes following antigen stimulation (PMID: 25087226, 15541657). BCL10 was discovered at the breakpoint of a recurrent translocation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B-cell lymphoma and subsequent experiments showed its role in apoptosis and NFkB regulation (PMID: 9989495, 10319863). Mutations in BCL10 have been found at low frequency in lymphomas and germ cell tumors (PMID: 10582682, 10408401).	true

BCL11B (also RIT1) is a transcription factor that is a member of the BCL family. BCL11B is predominantly expressed in T cells and the nervous system (PMID: 23211040). The activity of BCL11B is required for T cell development including lineage commitment, proliferation, differentiation and survival of T cells (PMID: 23211040) as well as in the development of cells in the central nervous system (PMID: 28424591, 29416501). In murine models, loss of BCL11B results in unsuccessful V(D)J recombination and lack of pre-T cell receptor (TCR) presentation on the cell surface (PMID: 12717433), highlighting the importance of BCL11B in T cell biology. BCL11B functions in a transcriptional complex with GATA3 to regulate gene expression in type 2 T helper cells (Th2 cells) (PMID: 29514917). BCL11B has many additional functions including regulation of chromatin state (PMID: 29466755), binding the nuclear hormone receptor NR2F1 (PMID: 23211040), and regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase during the cell cycle (PMID: 16950772). BCL11B acts as either a transcriptional activator or repressor in a context-specific manner (PMID: 23211040). Germline mutations in BCL11B have been identified in individuals with developmental disorders and immune deficiencies (PMID: 29985992, 27959755). Somatic mutations, fusions, and deletions of BCL11B are found in patients with adult T-ALL (PMID: 26219558, 25023966, 21878675). BCL11B functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, as most alterations are hemizygous (PMID: 26219558) and reduced expression of BCL11B is associated with poor prognosis in T-ALL (PMID: 25023966).	true

BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) is a key regulator of cell apoptosis, and is part of the BCL2 family of proteins that orchestrate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (PMID: 24355989). BCL2 is considered a pro-survival factor that inhibits BAX-mediated mitochondrial permeability, thus preventing cytochrome c release and downstream caspase 9 activation through APAF1 (PMID: 9390557, 9219694, 9390557). BCL2 is commonly linked to the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain locus in follicular B-cell lymphomas via the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (PMID:2875799). This results in robust expression of BCL2 and downstream pro-survival signals, a key step in lymphomagenesis (PMID:7632929). Progression of follicular lymphoma to a more aggressive disease state is often associated with MYC translocation, suggesting a synergy between BCL2 and MYC in cancer progression (PMID:1638027, 12015982). BCL2 is found to be translocated and overexpressed particularly in haematological malignancies, but is infrequently mutated (PMID: 3262202, 16193090). Venetoclax is a small molecule inhibitor of BCL2, and has been approved for treatment in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring a specific genetic alteration (PMID: 26639348).	false

BCL2L1 (Bcl-2-like protein 1) belongs to the BCL-2 family of proteins and has a dual pro- and anti-apoptotic role ascribed to its different transcript isoforms produced by alternative splicing (PMID: 8358789). The two isoforms, BCL-XL and BCL-XS, inhibit and activate apoptosis, respectively. BCL-XL sequesters activators of apoptosis such as BID, thus blocking downstream activation of the apoptosis effector proteins BAX and BAK, which normally control mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome C (PMID: 17115033, 20584903, 9393856). Inhibition of apoptosis by BCL-XL is overcome by caspase-mediated cleavage (PMID: 9771973, 21256112). Although the pro-apoptotic effect of BCL-XS is poorly understood, it has been shown to interact with BCL2 and BCL-XL (PMID: 10777212, 11526448). BCL2L1 is often amplified in colorectal cancers (CRC) and its expression affects anchorage-independent growth and cell proliferation, though it is not considered a driver of tumorigenesis (PMID: 22009326). Nevertheless, preclinical data has shown small molecules targeting BCL-XL may have therapeutic potential in a subset of CRCs and other cancers (PMID: 26134786, 25313317, 23824742).	false

BCL2L11 (also BIM) is a pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor that is a member of the BCL2 protein family (PMID: 9731710, 9430630). BCL2L11 expression activates apoptosis by triggering the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c release initiates a series of signaling events that result in apoptosome formation and activation of caspase-mediated programmed cell death (PMID: 19934277, 26405162, 16243507). The anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 sequesters BCL2L11; therefore, the relative levels of BCL2L11 and BCL2 regulate many cellular processes including cell survival and tissue homeostasis (PMID: 9430630, 10576740, 25176652). There are several alternatively-spliced BIM isoforms with various levels of pro-apoptotic activity (PMID: 22728771). Expression of BIM is epigenetically downregulated in several cancer types, including chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 19403302, 20647567). Furthermore, BCL2L11 activity, in addition to a BCL2L11 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), has been shown to be a predictor of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in several contexts (PMID: 22145099, 24223824). Thus, Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics may have utility in cancers that are resistant to TKIs through a BIM-dependent mechanism (PMID: 18949058). Chemoresistance mechanisms may also arise due to downregulation of BCL2L11 expression (PMID: 18174237).	true

BCL3, an atypical IkB family member, finely regulates the classical and non-classical NFkB pro-inflammatory response by both repressing and activating NFkB signaling (PMID: 31930327, 1532257). Phosphorylation of BCL3, regulated by the MAPK and AKT pathways, promotes its nuclear localization, stabilization, and recruitment to DNA (PMID: 28689659). BCL3 promotes proliferation via myc and cyclin D, contributes to invasion and metastasis, and evades apoptosis via HDM2, DNA-dependent protein kinases, caspases, and AKT (PMID: 31930327). In cancer, BCL3 is translocated adjacent to the IGH gene forming the oncogenic t(14;19)(q32.3;q13.1) IGH-BCL3 fusion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 2083219, 2180580, 1532257). BCL3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, in which it has been shown to promote stemness (PMID: 20414006, 30792270).

It also suppresses terminal differentiation of germinal center B-cells, and downregulation of BCL6 is necessary for further B-cell differentiation (PMID: 18452090, 11452114). BCL6 is a proto-oncogene that is commonly translocated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (PMID: 15202519, 8167331). This translocation, as well as BCL6 somatic mutations found in DLBCL, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and breast cancer, are proposed to deregulate BCL6 expression, resulting in its oncogenic potential (PMID: 25038272, 18452090, 24662818).

BCL7A functions in negatively regulating the Wnt signaling pathway and positively regulating the apoptotic pathway (PMID: 25569233). Ectopic expression of BCL7A in acute myeloid leukemia cell and xenograft models represses tumor growth and cellular proliferation, suggesting that BCL7A functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 36941700). Downregulated BCL7A has been identified as a risk factor and prognostic biomarker for various types of cancer, including glioma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and ovarian cancer (PMID: 34362400, 19336552, 15897551, 31077237).	true

BCL9 is a transcriptional adaptor protein that is a regulator of WNT signaling (PMID: 11955446, 16377174). BCL9 is a nuclear protein that binds the Î²-catenin-TCF complex, the transcriptional coactivator complex that is downstream of the WNT signaling pathway (PMID: 11955446). BCL9 is also a member of the WNT enhanceosome, a multiprotein complex that regulates the activity of TCF/LEF-responsive enhancer genes (PMID: 28296634). As a component of the WNT enhanceosome, BCL9 recruits additional co-regulators that activate the transcriptional activity of Î²-catenin depending on the cellular context (PMID: 11955446, 28103279). Namely, BCL9 interacts with Pygo, a protein that binds H3K4 methylation sites on chromatin, implicating BCL9 in epigenetic regulation (PMID: 19305417, 18498752). In addition, BCL9 is a critical mediator of cell-type specific WNT-dependent transcriptional activity (PMID: 18347063, 19699733. 28174279, 30366904). BCL9-mediated WNT signaling regulates several cellular functions including migration, gene expression, mesoderm patterning, proliferation, and adhesion, among others (PMID: 15371335, 19305417, 19738061). Downregulation of BCL9 in biochemical experiments results in translocation of Î²-catenin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, leading to altered gene expression (PMID: 15371335). Overexpression of BCL9 and recurrent BCL9 fusions have been identified in patients with B-cell malignancies and acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 9490669, 10602418), suggesting that BCL9 functions as an oncogene.

BCOR (BCL6 co-repressor) is a transcriptional repressor that is required for normal germinal center formation in B cells (PMID: 27505670). BCOR is a chromatin regulatory protein that functions in a variety of non-canonical epigenetic repressive complexes and binds the transcriptional repressor BCL6 (PMID: 27505670, 29337181). Depletion of BCOR results in loss of Polycomb protein binding at target genes, which is critical for maintaining repressed chromatin (PMID: 9337181). Additionally, the presence of RING1 and RNF2 in the BCOR complex suggests BCOR involvement in the ubiquitination of histones (PMID: 19738629). BCOR functions as a tumor suppressor that is a key regulator of early embryonic development, mesenchymal stem cell function, hematopoiesis and vertebrate laterality (PMID: 17517692, 18795143, 19578371, 10898795). Germline mutations in BCOR are responsible for the inherited oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes (PMID: 15004558). BCOR fusions are recurrent in soft tissue and endometrial stromal sarcomas (PMIDs: 22387997, 25176412, 24805859, 25360585), as well as in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (PMID: 20807888). These fusions lead to oncogenesis by activating various anti-apoptotic pathways. BCOR has been identified as both the N-terminal and the C-terminal fusion partner depending on the type of cancer in which it is expressed, suggesting differing mechanisms for oncogenesis in these tumors (PMID: 25360585). Somatic BCOR truncating mutations have also been identified in retinoblastoma and hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (PMID: 22237022, 22012066, 24047651, 25550361).	true

BCORL1 is a transcription factor that functions to repress gene expression (PMID: 17379597). BCORL1, a homolog of the BCOR repressor, interacts with histone deacetylases to mediate transcriptional repression (PMID: 17379597). In addition, BCORL1 interacts with the CtBP corepressor and plays a role in repression of E-Cadherin, an important gene in the epithelial to mesenchymal transformation. Loss of BCORL1 results in promotion of migration and invasion in hepatocellular cancer cell lines (PMID: 26879601). BCORL1 also binds proteins in the epigenetic Polycomb Repressive 1 (PRC1) complex and mediates chromatin state changes (PMID: 27568929). Somatic mutations in BCORL1 are found in patients with adult and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), astrocytomas and intracranial germ cell tumors (PMID: 21989985, 24047651, 24896186, 27470916, 27425854) and are predicted to be loss-of-function mutations resulting in truncation of the C-terminus of the protein. Mutations in BCORL1 are associated with age-related clonal disorders of hematopoiesis, which are hematopoietic defects that can transform to MDS or AML (PMID: 25326804, 26132940, 27084249). Overexpression of BCORL1 is also found in a subset of tumors, including in hepatocellular cancer (PMID: 26879601). BCORL1 mutations have also been shown to be relevant to vemurafenib resistance in melanoma (PMID: 29605720).	true

BCR is a signaling molecule with serine/threonine kinase activity (PMID: 23940119). BCR has been reported to function as both a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which promotes the activation of RhoA family GTPases (PMID: 23940119), and a GTPase activating protein (GAP), which inactivates GTPase activity by stimulating the activity of the small GTP binding proteins Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 (PMID: 7889565). In keratinocytes, BCR promotes the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, an important function for cellular migration (PMID: 23940119). Loss of BCR in mice results in normal development, however; mice develop a neutrophil expansion due to an increase in reactive oxygen metabolite production (PMID: 7889565). BCR also functions as a mediator of signaling and has modular domains that serve as binding sites for GRB2, GRB10, 14-3-3 and the ABL proteins (PMID: 15719031). BCR is most commonly studied as a translocation partner in the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein (or Philadelphia chromosome), which leads to a constitutively active kinase. The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is found in essentially all cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and a small proportion of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). BCR-ABL1 binds signaling molecules, including SOS and GRB2, and initiates downstream signaling pathways including the PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways (PMID: 15719031). BCR-ABL1-translocated cancers are sensitive to the kinase inhibitor imatinib, and second-generation kinase inhibitors have been identified that target drug resistance mechanisms that arise in response to imatinib (PMID: 17457302).	false

BIRC3 (baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3, or cIAP2) is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins and contains catalytic ubiquitinase activity (PMID: 8548810, 20651737). BIRC3 activates the canonical NFÎºB signaling pathway following tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Î± binding to TNFR1 (TNF receptor 1). TNFR1 activation triggers assembly of a complex wherein BIRC3 mediates ubiquitination of several factors, resulting in derepression of NFÎºB (PMID: 20651737, 11907583). BIRC3 also activates non-canonical NFÎºB signaling by mediating ubiquitination of NIK (NFÎºB-inducing kinase) (PMID: 20651737, 11907583). In addition, BIRC3 functions as an inhibitor of apoptosis by directly ubiquitinating caspases 3 and 7 (PMID: 20651737), targeting them for degradation. BIRC3 and its homolog, BIRC2 (cIAP1), are functionally redundant in preclinical model systems, but also have non-overlapping expression patterns suggesting distinct biological functions (PMID: 20651737, 21430708). Somatic BIRC3 truncating mutations and deletions have been identified in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 26837699, 22308293). In addition, BIRC3 amplifications have been identified in lung cancers (PMID: 12651874).	false	
ENST00000355112	NM_000057.2	ENST00000355112	NM_000057.2	641	BLM	false			BLM is a tumor suppressor involved in DNA repair. Germline mutations of BLM are associated with Bloom syndrome and predispose to certain cancers.	BLM (also Bloom syndrome protein) is a DNA helicase that functions by unwinding double-stranded DNA intermediates during multiple cellular functions, including double-strand break repair by homologous recombination, telomere maintenance and replication (PMID: 21047263, 24606147). BLM gene expression is cell cycle regulated and BLM has been shown to interact with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mindbomb 1 (MIB1) and a highly conserved DNA topoisomerase 2Î²-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) (PMID: 24239288). The helicase activity of BLM is critical for preserving the fidelity of the genome, and deleterious mutations result in a strong predisposition for a broad spectrum of cancers across multiple tissue types, generally characterized as highly aggressive and occurring early in life. Germline mutations in BLM lead to the rare genetic disorder Bloom syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe chromosomal instability and increased cancer risk (PMID: 17407155). Heterozygous inherited deleterious mutations in BLM have been associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (PMID: 23028338) and colorectal cancers (PMID: 26358404), albeit with a moderate penetrance for the latter. Somatic mutations in BLM are rare in human cancers, however, truncating mutations in BLM have been identified in colorectal cancers with a microsatellite instability (PMID: 11532193).	true

Germline mutations of BMPR1A are associated with juvenile intestinal polyposis and Cowden syndrome.	BMPR1A is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor that belongs to the transforming growth factor Î² (TGF Î²) family (PMID: 22992590). TGFÃ signaling controls multiple biological processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation and tissue homeostasis (PMID: 22992590, 11057902). BMPR1A functions as a type I receptor and therefore must associate with the type II receptor BMPR2 to initiate ligand binding (PMID: 22992590). BMP receptors receive signals from growth factor and cytokine BMP ligands and transduce these signals through SMAD and non-SMAD pathways to regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis (PMID: 10712517, 9738456, 19762341). BMPR1A signaling also plays a role in apoptosis, osteoblast function and adipocyte differentiation (PMID: 15090551). Germline mutations of BMPR1A are found in individuals with juvenile polyposis syndrome, juvenile intestinal polyposis and Cowden syndrome (PMID: 15235019, 11536076). BMPR1A mutations are associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal polyps and colon cancer (PMID: 25389115, 21203531).	true

BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (PMID: 15520807), which under physiologic conditions regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular functions, including proliferation (PMID: 24202393). Genetic alterations in BRAF are found in a large percentage of melanomas, thyroid cancers and histiocytic neoplasms as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to constitutive BRAF activation, as BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer independently of RAS or upstream activation (PMID: 20179705). Other BRAF mutations have been found that affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582, 12068308). The product of these alterations is a BRAF kinase that can activate MAPK signaling in an unregulated manner and, in some instances, is directly responsible for cancer growth (PMID: 15520807). Inhibitors of mutant BRAF, including vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are FDA-approved for the treatment of late-stage or unresectable melanoma.	false

BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) is a tumor suppressor gene that functions as a multifunctional ubiquitin E3 ligase. BRCA1 has been implicated in regulating diverse cellular processes including transcription, protein ubiquitination, cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response, with a particularly important role in DNA repair during homologous recombination (PMID: 22193408). BRCA1 forms protein complexes with known tumor suppressors including RAD51, BRCA2, BARD1 and PALB2; specifically, BRCA1 and BARD1 facilitate resection of DNA ends and enhance the activity of the recombinase RAD51 (PMID: 14636569, 20729832, 20930833, 20871615, 20729858, 28976962). BRCA1 was the first breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene identified and cloned; inherited mutations in this gene lead to an increased lifetime risk of developing these cancers. BRCA1 mutations confer a 70-80% lifetime risk of breast cancer, a 50% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer and an increased risk of prostate cancer in patients with Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 founder mutations (PMID: 22193408). If one copy of BRCA1 is mutated in the germline, the result is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease (PMID: 22193408). BRCA1 was also recently identified as a definitive Fanconi anemia susceptibility gene in FANCS, a rare Fanconi anemia subtype that results from biallelic mutations in the gene (PMID: 25472942). BRCA1 mutations are predicted to disrupt protein-protein interactions, which facilitate DNA repair (PMID: 1157308, 10918303). Mutations in TP53 in breast tumors are seen almost exclusively with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, suggesting that TP53 loss of function may be a necessary step in the tumorigenesis of BRCA-associated carcinomas (PMID: 14672397).

BRCA2 has been implicated in regulating diverse cellular processes including transcription, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage response, with a particularly important role in DNA repair during homologous recombination (PMID: 22193408). BRCA2 forms protein complexes with known tumor suppressors including RAD51, BRCA1, and PALB2; specifically, BRCA2 binds single-stranded DNA and loads RAD51 monomers at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (PMID: 14636569, 20729832, 20930833, 20871615, 20729858, 28976962). RAD51 requires the BRCA1-BRCA2-PALB2 complex to initiate homologous recombination (PMID: 11239455). BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor protein; if one copy of the gene is inactivated in the germline, the result is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease (PMID: 22193408, 15800615). BRCA2 was also identified as a definitive Fanconi anemia susceptibility gene that results from biallelic mutations in the gene (PMID: 12065746). Germline BRCA2 mutations confer a 50-60% lifetime risk of breast cancer, a 30% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a 20-fold increased risk of prostate cancer, and a risk for the development of a broad range of cancers (PMID: 22193408, 31343663).

BRD3 (bromodomain containing 3) is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily of bromodomain-containing proteins that regulate transcription through the recognition and binding of acetylated lysine residues on histones and transcription factors (PMID: 25849938, 31780938).  BRD3 is an epigenetic reader (PMID: 31780938) and acts as a transcription regulator via association with the transcription factor GATA1 (PMID: 21536911). BRD3 has been shown to regulate processes such as skeletal myogenesis and erythroid maturation, among others (PMID: 28733670, 21536911). Translocations of BRD3 that fuse the gene to the 5' end of NUTM1 result in the oncogenic BRD3-NUTM1 fusion, which has been identified as a driver of NUT midline carcinoma (PMID: 25688404, 32328562).

BRD4 is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, and is important in transcriptional activation and elongation at specific gene enhancer elements (PMID: 20871596). BRD4 binds to acetylated histone lysine motifs and helps recruit members of the transcriptional regulator complex, including P-TEFb and Mediator, which are necessary for PolII-dependent transcriptional elongation (PMID: 24751816). BRD4 has been shown to have a role in inflammation (PMID: 21068722, 25263595), viral gene expression (PMID: 16109376) and heart failure (PMID: 23911322). A subset of regulatory elements termed 'super-enhancers' are bound by high levels of BRD4 and are particularly prone to transcriptional perturbations of BRD4 inhibition (BETi) via small molecules (PMID: 24905006, 23582323). For example, BETi results in significant reduction of MYC downstream activity via its super-enhancer. As such, experimental data has shown that MYC-driven cancers are particularly sensitive to BETi, including multiple myeloma (PMID: 21889194) and medulloblastoma (PMID: 24297863). A chromosomal BRD4-NUT fusion product is a driver of disease in most cases of NUT midline carcinoma and is sensitive to BETi (PMID: 20871596). Resistance to BETi can arise due to BRD4 hyperphosphorylation in breast cancer (PMID: 26735014), and SPOP mutations, which can lead to BRD4 stabilization in prostate cancer (PMID: 28805820).	false

DEAH helicases participate in pre-messenger RNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis (PMID: 20168331). This family of genes includes those that have been implicated in heritable human diseases, including BLM, WRN and RECQL4 (PMID: 24606147). Specifically, BRIP1 interacts with the BRCT motif-containing domain of BRCA1 (PMID: 17033622). In the HCC1937 cell line that produces BRCA1 with a truncated C-terminal, BRIP1 failed to co-immunoprecipitate with BRCA1, suggesting this domain is important for interaction with BRIP1 (PMID: 11301010). In the same study, two intact BRCT repeat units on BRCA1 were shown to be necessary for the BRCA1 and BRIP1 interaction; a mutation at K52R on BRIP1 may control the interaction of the two proteins. BRIP1 has been shown to be mutated in hereditary breast (PMID: 11301010, 17033622), ovarian (PMID: 21964575) and prostate (PMID: 19127258) cancers as well as the Fanconi anemia (FA), a disorder caused by genetic defects in a number of proteins involved in DNA repair that is characterized by bone marrow failure, sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and the development of cancer, often acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (PMID: 24348213, 16493006).

Activated BRSK1 regulates cell cycle progression by phosphorylating tubulin, which is critical for centrosome duplication (PMID: 19648910). Activated BRSK1 also phosphorylates and downregulates Wee1A and Cdc25-B/C, which regulates neuronal polarity and leads to G2/M arrest in response to UV- or MMS-induced DNA damage (PMID: 15705853, 20026642, 15150265). Truncating mutations of BRSK1 are found in MSI-high gastric and colorectal cancers (PMID: 27677186).

BTG1 is a member of a family of proteins that regulate cell proliferation. BTG1 acts as an adaptor molecule that stimulates the activity of transcription factors including HOXB9 and RARÎ± (PMID: 19746446). In addition, BTG1 regulates the activity of an epigenetic complex containing PRMT1, an arginine methyltransferase (PMID: 26657730). Expression of BTG1 is important for regulation of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in a variety of cellular contexts (PMID: 26622543). Deadenylation of poyl(A) tails on mRNA is also mediated by BTG1 binding to CNOT7, allowing for regulation of mRNA turnover and decay (PMID: 19746446). BTG1 transcriptional control is important for cerebellum and pre-B cell development as demonstrated in murine models (PMID: 27036158, 26524254). Loss of BTG1 enhances the stem cell renewal capacity of hematopoietic progenitor cells and mediates the upregulation of BCL6, leading to suppression of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and p19ARF (PMID: 29408281). Somatic BTG1 loss-of-function mutations occur in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and deletions occur in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (PMID: 22343534, 29407587, 27151989), suggesting that BTG1 functions as a tumor suppressor.

BTK (Brutonâs agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in B-cell activation. The B-cell receptor (BCR) activates BTK when BCR-associated tyrosine kinases (such as SYK and LYN) phosphorylate BTK at the plasma membrane (PMID: 8629002, 29861875). The main target of BTK phosphorylation is phospholipase C-Î³2 (PLCÎ³2) which leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways including NFAT, NFkB and MAPK pathways (PMID: 8691147, 10811867). BTK signaling is also implicated in chemokine receptor signaling in lymphocyte trafficking and in Toll-like receptor signaling in the immune response (PMID: 17239630, 23967355). Loss-of-function mutations in BTK result in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a disorder that results in the failure of pre-B cells in the bone marrow to differentiate into mature circulating B cells (PMID: 8380905). While somatic mutations in BTK are not common, BTK signaling is critical for growth of B-cell derived malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) (PMID: 24658273). BTK is also overexpressed in B-cell malignancies (PMID: 21422473, 23962569). BTK inhibition has been a successful means of therapy in hematologic malignancies. The tyrosine kinase ibrutinib targets BTK and is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with MCL, CLL, and WM (PMID: 25361916).

Voltage-sensitive calcium channels, such as Cav1.3, function in mediating calcium ion entry into excitable cells to regulate calcium-dependent physiological processes (PMID: 29038230,  26842699, 23913004). CACNA1D directly interacts with the GABA(B) receptor to upregulate MAPK signaling pathways and regulate cellular proliferation (PMID: 22366257).

CACNA1D overexpression and expression of CACNA1D gain-of-function alterations in prostate cancer and aldosterone-producing adenoma cell models induces increased cellular proliferation, suggesting that CACNA1D functions predominantly as an oncogene in these contexts (PMID: 36949059, 23913001, 28781648, 28584016). Amplification and activating mutations of CACNA1D have been identified in gastric cancer, prostate cancer and aldosterone-producing adenoma (PMID: 35590368, 36949059, 24054868, 23913004). Conversely, downregulation of CACNA1D has also been identified in various cancer types, including myeloma, sarcoma and renal tumors (PMID: 28781648).	false

CAD encodes for a trifunctional multi-domain protein that functions primarily in pyrimidine biosynthesis through carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activity (PMID: 1967494). De novo synthesis of pyrimidine is required for cellular proliferation (PMID: 12438317). MAPK and mTORC1 phosphorylation causes CAD to become more sensitive to activation and upregulates biosynthesis of pyrimidines for increased cellular proliferation (PMID: 10659854, 23429704). Overexpression of CAD in various cancer cell lines and models induces increased cellular proliferation, suggesting that CAD functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 33670206, 16155188, 32325032).

ENST00000316448	NM_004343.3	ENST00000316448	NM_004343.3	811	CALR	true			CALR, a calcium-binding protein, is altered in various solid and hematologic malignancies including myeloproliferative neoplasms.	CALR, also known as calreticulin, is a calcium-binding protein located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the ER, the CALR protein has two primary functions: molecular chaperone in the protein-folding pathway and regulator of calcium homeostasis (PMID: 25918716). As a molecular chaperone, CALR acts to prevent the aggregation and export of partially or incorrectly folded proteins from the ER to the Golgi (PMID: 16467570). The activity of CALR and its paralog CNX (calnexin) is important to ensure the quality of glycoproteins, including membrane-bound proteins, transporters and certain secreted factors (PMID: 10567207). Additionally, CALR is localized to the nucleus and inhibits the function of nuclear hormone receptors, such as the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (PMID: 8107808, 8107809, 7556879, 9013706, 7667104). CALR also has important roles in immune regulation including folding of MHC Class I molecules and serving as an âeat meâ signal on cancer cells (PMID: 25918716). Recurrent somatic mutations in CALR have been identified in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms that lack alterations in JAK2 or MPL, suggesting a role in activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 24325356, 24325359, 25873496). Alterations in CALR commonly occur as frameshift mutations in the C-terminal region of CALR, truncating the ER-targeting domain of the protein (PMID: 26951227). CALR mutations disrupt the interaction between CALR and membrane receptors (such as MPL) and activate downstream signaling pathways (PMID: 26951227). Somatic CALR mutations are also found in familial cases of thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis (PMID: 24553179).	false

CANT1, a member of the apyrase family, encodes for a calcium-dependent nucleotidase which hydrolyzes the UDP, GDP, UTP and GTP nucleotides with a preference for UDP (PMID: 12600208, 12234496). Alterations of CANT1 have been identified to impair endoplasmic reticulum function and proteoglycan synthesis (PMID: 19853239, 22539336). Germline mutations of CANT1 have been identified to cause dysfunction in cartilage proteoglycan synthesis and are associated with the autosomal recessive condition Desbuquois dysplasia (PMID: 21412251, 25486376,19853239, 30439444). Silencing and knockdown of CANT1 in various cancer cell lines suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that CANT1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31102300, 35090419, 35068336, 21435463).

CARD11 (caspase recruitment domain 11) is a cytoplasmic scaffold protein that functions in mediating apoptosis and NF-Ä¸B signaling via the CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) complex (PMID:11278692). Upregulation of CARD11 by protein kinase C (PKC) leads to a conformational change of the protein and formation of the CBM complex, resulting in activation of NF-Ä¸B through the IÄ¸B kinase (PMID: 26260210, 26212909). In mouse B-cells, CARD11 is a molecular switch defining either the occurrence of activation-induced cell death or proliferation and plasmablast differentiation (PMID: 23027925). CARD11 is an oncogene, and constitutive activation of the CBM complex is a common feature of B- and T-cell malignancies, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma where gain-of-function mutations in CARD11 have been identified (PMID: 18323416).	false

CARM1 is a methyltransferase that modifies arginines seventeen and twenty-six of histones and other proteins. CARM1 is recruited, along with EP300 and the NCOA-family of histone acetyltransferases, to active gene promoters, playing a role in transcriptional activation via chromatin remodeling (PMID: 16497732, 19405910). CARM1 is a positive regulator of WNT/Î²-catenin expression, induces growth and proliferation in colon cancer cells (PMID: 21478268), and synergistically co-activates NF-kB pathway with EP300 in fibroblasts (PMID: 15616592).

CASP8 is a cysteine protease that is a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. CASP8 functions as the main initiator caspase that mediates death receptor-induced apoptosis (PMID: 9729047). Proteolytic activation of CASP8 is induced by the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) involving CD95 (Fas/Apo1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors and TNF receptors (PMID: 25617598, 18073771). Upon activation, CASP8 can directly cleave other caspases, such as CASP3, or engage the mitochondrial pathway by cleavage of BID (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) (PMID: 9727492, 9501089, 10428830). Conversely, CASP8 has pro-survival activity roles in the anti-apoptotic NF-ÎºB pathway (PMID: 11002417, 10753878, 15746428) and by inhibiting receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3)-dependent necroptosis (PMID: 21368763, 24476434). Other non-proteolytic functions of CASP8 have been identified in neuroblastoma and lung cancer cell lines including the promotion of cell adhesion, (PMID: 18089800, 18089778), motility (PMID: 18216014, 16618751, 18089778), metastasis (PMID: 16397500) and pyroptosis (PMID: 31723262, 31748744). Caspase-8 deficiency state (CEDS) is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by CASP8 mutations and resembles autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) (PMID: 12353035). Inactivating somatic mutations, as well as gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation of CASP8, have been observed in different cancers including hepatocellular, gastric, colorectal, central nervous system malignancies and head and neck cancers (PMID: 25631445, 28112728, 15705878, 12949717).	true

CBFA2T3, a member of the myeloid translocation gene family, encodes for a transcriptional corepressor that interacts with DNA-bound transcription factors to facilitate transcriptional repression (PMID: 12559562, 15203199). CBFA2T3 contributes to the inhibition of the glycolysis pathway through transcriptional repression of glycolytic genes in the HIF-1a pathway (PMID: 23840896, 25974097). The oncogenic function of CBFA2T3 may be likely tissue specific. Ectopic expression of CBFA2T3 in breast cancer cell lines reduced colony growth, suggesting that CBFA2T3 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in that context (PMID: 12183414). Loss of CBFA2T3 has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer and lung cancer (PMID: 12183414, 13680524, 34164477). CBFA2T3 has been recurrently identified in the t(16;21) (q24;q22) chromosomal translocation in the context of therapy-related myeloid malignancies and is associated with poor patient prognosis (PMID: 31040112, 32434928, 22420028, 23407549, 9596646, 23153540). CBFA2T3 fusions are suggested to promote oncogenesis of therapy-related myeloid malignancies through inhibition of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated myeloid gene expression and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) target gene transcription (PMID: 32434928).	true

The CBFB (core-binding factor, beta subunit) gene encodes a heterodimeric transcription factor component, that together with a core-binding factor alpha component, RUNX1/2/3 (Runt related transcription factor) proteins, forms a transcription factor complex (PMID: 8929538). CBFB is a non-DNA binding subunit that functions to enhance the DNA binding of the CBF alpha component. The CBF complex targets specific genes for activation or repression and also recruits activating or repressive cofactors such as p300 and HDACs (Histone deacetylases) (PMID: 23148227, 21059642). CBFB complexed with RUNX1 regulates important steps in hematopoiesis through processes such as cell cycle progression, differentiation and development (PMID: 11561154). With RUNX2, CBFB regulates skeletal development (PMID: 12434152, 24798493). Inversion of chromosome 16 can result in a CBFB-MYH11 (Myosin heavy chain 11) fusion gene and is associated with the M4 type of acute myeloid leukemia, and often with associated eosinophilia (PMID: 23160462). This fusion protein disrupts the CBF complex and results in a block in hematopoiesis (PMID: 20007544). CBFB may also influence solid tumor development, as mutations have been identified in breast and cervical cancer samples (PMID: 22722202, 24390348).	true

CBL is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase and proto-oncogene that mediates degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases (PMID: 11283727, 23085373). CBL family E3 ligases selectively and negatively regulate activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR (PMID: 23085373), PDGFR (PMID: 11283727), CSF-1R (PMID: 11283727), MET (PMID: 24384534), and FLT3 (PMID: 17446348), through ubiquitylation that targets these proteins for degradation by the proteasome (PMID: 11283727). The activity of CBL is required to negatively regulate various signaling pathways, most commonly in hematopoietic and immune cells (PMID: 11857085). In addition to receptor tyrosine kinase regulation, CBL-b is also involved in T cell activation and peripheral T cell tolerance (PMID: 24875217, 17704644, 11283727). Germline mutations in CBL result in developmental delays and a predisposition for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (PMID: 20694012). Somatic alterations in CBL have been identified in several human cancers including myelodysplastic syndromes, lung adenocarcinoma and cutaneous melanoma (PMID: 26343386, 11857085). In BCR-ABL rearranged mutant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), CBL expression is downregulated by the BCR-ABL fusion leading to aberrant activation of downstream signaling pathways (PMID: 11857085).	true

CCNB3 (Cyclin B3) is a cyclin protein involved in the positive regulation of cell cycle control. In normal cells, cyclin B3 is exclusively expressed in the testis and is only active during spermatogenesis as a meiotic cyclin thought to be linked to the transition from pre-meiotic to meiotic prophase (PMID: 12185076). In vitro studies have demonstrated that cyclin B3 is able to bind to CDK2; however, it is unable to activate the associated histone H1 kinase activity (PMID: 12185076). CCNB3 is most commonly altered by missense mutations or gene amplifications/deletions in multiple cancer types. Gene fusions with CCNB3 occur most frequently in undifferentiated sarcomas, which lead to aberrant expression of CCNB3 in the mutated cells (PMID: 22387997, 25360585).	false

CCND1 (cyclin D1) is a protein that couples extracellular growth signaling to cell cycle entry through the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6 (PMID: 8114739). Upon forming a complex with cyclin D1, CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylate and inactivate retinoblastoma (RB), thus leading to the induction of a gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors that is important in the transition from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle (PMID: 12432268, 8114703). Functions of cyclin D1 include control of cell growth, proliferation, transcription, DNA repair, and migration (PMID: 21734724). Cyclin D1 is an oncogene, and is often overexpressed or amplified in numerous cancers, including breast, lung, melanoma, and oral squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 20164920, 20029424). Cyclin D1 is not essential for entry into cell cycle progression (PMID: 15315760), however, its amplification/overexpression in human tumors is oncogenic as it allows cancer cells to proliferate independently of extracellular growth signaling cues (PMID: 23644662, 20029424).	false

The cyclin E1-CDK2 complex phosphorylates p27(Kip1) and p21, which signals for the degradation of cyclin D and promotes the expression of cyclin A, leading to progression through S phase of the cell cycle (PMID:9192873). Cyclin E1-CDK2 phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma protein (RB), thus leading to the induction of a gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors that is important in the transition from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle (PMID: 1388095). Cyclin E1-CDK2 is degraded by SCF-Fbw7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is commonly mutated in cancer (PMID: 11533444 ). Increased cyclin E expression in cell lines leads to quicker passage through the G1/S phase, but deletion of cyclin E or CDK2 in mice does not result in a G1/S defect (PMID: 12941272).

CCNQ forms a heterodimeric complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 10 (CDK10), which phosphorylates the transcription factor ETS2 (PMID: 24218572). Phosphorylation targets ETS2 for degradation via the 26S proteasome leading to altered cell cycle progression and proliferation (PMID: 24218572). In addition, CCNQ activity has been associated with actin organization and ciliogenesis (PMID: 27104747). Germline loss-of-function mutations and deletions in CCNQ have been identified in patients with STAR syndrome, an X-linked hereditary condition characterized by toe syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations (PMID: 18297069, 29088509). Alterations in CCNQ/cyclin M stabilize ETS2 protein levels, increase c-RAF signaling, and confer tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells (PMID: 24218572).

CD19, a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, encodes for the transmembrane glycoprotein coreceptor of the B-cell antigen receptor complex (BCR) found on the cell surface of B-cells (PMID: 23210908). CD19 functions as an adaptor protein to recruit cytoplasmic signaling proteins to the B-cell membrane and as a member of the CD19/CD21 complex to enhance antigen signaling for the B-cell signaling pathways (PMID: 23210908, 11418645). As a coreceptor of the BCR, CD19 mediates signals to drive B-cell survival, differentiation and proliferation (PMID: 15963789, 12496385, 16116172). Upregulation of CD19 in mouse models induces increased MYC signaling, B-cell transformation and lymphoma progression, suggesting that CD19 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 22826319, 23210908). CD19 amplification has been identified in various types of hematologic B-cell malignancies, including B-cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 23210908, 3257143). Individuals with B-cell malignancies expressing CD19 should be considered for immunotherapies targeting CD19. Loncastuximab tesirine, a monoclonal antibody conjugate targeting CD19, is FDA-approved for the treatment of pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (PMID: 33989558).

CD22 functions as an inhibitory receptor that can physically associate with the B-cell receptor (BCR) to inhibit signaling (PMID: 22566885). CD22 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) at the cytoplasmic tail to recruit tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and inositol phosphatase SHIP to negatively regulate BCR signaling (PMID: 23836650, 10748054). Inhibition of BCR signaling prevents internalization and processing of antigens to present to T cells (PMID: 3157869).

CD276 is a transmembrane protein found in various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and osteoclasts; however, post-transcriptional mechanisms reduce the steady-state levels of CD276 protein (PMID: 27208063). Expression of CD276 is also found on antigen-presenting cells in response to inflammation, including on dendritic and natural killer cells, which likely play important roles in T-cell mediated immune response (PMID: 27208063, 22437870, 11224528, 12925852). Loss of CD276 in murine models results in overactivation of the immune system, demonstrating that CD276 negatively regulates T-cell proliferation (PMID: 12925852). CD276 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and has been associated with cancer progression and immune evasion (PMID: 24892449, 22473715, 16489649, 18042703, 23940627, 21671471, 31075138). In addition, CD276 is overexpressed on the cell surface of cancer cells and dampens T-cell inhibitory responses, including in pediatric brain tumors (PMID: 32341579, 29860983). Immunotherapies targeting CD276, such as monoclonal antibodies and engineered CAR T-cell therapy, are currently under clinical investigation (PMID: 30753824, 30655315, 22615450, 29914796, 32398947).	false

CD28 is a costimulatory receptor required for T cell activation and survival (PMID: 27192564). CD28 is expressed predominantly on T cells and mediates various T cell processes including differentiation, survival, cytokine production, and immune homeostasis (PMID: 27192564, 29163534). The pairing of CD28 with a B7 protein presented on an antigen presenting cell enhances the activity of MHC (major histocompatibility complex)-TCR (T cell receptor signal) complexes and CD28-B7 coupling is required to initiate a T cell response (PMID: 8642283). The ligands that bind CD28 are CD86, which is constitutively expressed on antigen presenting cells, and CD80, which is upregulated after CD28-CD80 binding (PMID: 27192564, 14978077). CTLA4 and CD28 compete for the same ligands, and subsequent CD80 upregulation following CD28 stimulation may promote immune suppression (PMID: 7682233, 27192564). CD28 is expressed on other immune cells, including plasma cells and T regulatory cells, and plays a role in antibody production and the inflammatory response (PMID: 7534672, 12616483). CD28 engagement initiates several signal transduction pathways due to the association of signaling molecules with the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 (PMID: 8067997, 8025954). CD28 function is dysregulated in autoimmune disorders and cancers (PMID: 28711152, 27460989). CD28 agonists and antagonists are FDA-approved for a variety of immune-related disorders to modulate the function of T effector and T regulatory cells (PMID: 27192564).	false

CD58 (also LFA-3) is a cell surface ligand that functions as an immune cell adhesion molecule. CD58 binds CD2, a receptor expressed on T lymphocytes, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, to promote cell adhesion to target cells and to provide a stimulatory signal for T cells (PMID: 2951597, 29564225). Co-stimulation resulting from CD2-CD58 engagement results in proliferation, cytokine production and effector function in immune cells (PMID: 26041540). Antibodies targeting CD58 result in blunted immune recognition and reduced cytolysis of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells in preclinical studies (PMID: 3084649). CD58 expression is reduced in some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphomas, resulting in tumor cells lacking the necessary cell surface molecules for immune recognition (PMID: 22137796, 24413734). Somatic mutations and deletions in CD58 have been identified in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and other lymphomas, contributing to immune evasion (PMID: 26194173, 22137796, 24413734, 27825110). In DLBCL, concurrent downregulation of both CD58 and HLA-1 molecules results in immune escape from T and NK cells (PMID: 22137796).	true

CD74, a member of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II family, encodes for an invariant chain that functions primarily in antigen presentation for the generation of CD4+ T-cell immune responses (PMID: 30723591). CD74 also functions as a cell surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response (PMID: 32004754, 12782713). Overexpression of CD74 in various cancer cell lines and models induces xenograft tumor growth and increases actin polymerization, suggesting that CD74 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 27626171). Amplification of CD74 has been identified in various types of cancer, including gastrointestinal cancer, glioma and thyroid carcinoma (PMID: 21228923, 34540893, 25600560). CD74 expression is a potential therapeutic target with preclinical studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy of anti-CD74 inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates in various types of cancer (PMID: 25600560, 23427296, 22611320, 28466956, 36634212).	false

CD79A is a surface immunoglobulin protein that forms a complex with CD79B and composes part of the B-cell receptor (BCR) (PMID: 1439759). CD79A is expressed from an early stage of B-cell development until the final stage of maturation prior to differentiation into plasma cells (PMID: 21841126, 24146823). The CD79A/CD79B complex is important for transmitting signals generated by antigen binding to the BCR into the cell to support B-cell maturation and survival (PMID: 15186779). Following BCR-ligand interaction, CD79A and CD79B are phosphorylated and activated by SRC family kinases leading to activation of downstream oncogenic signaling cascades that affect B-cell maturation (PMID: 17114463, 15699130, 20940318, 22078222,11514602). Activating mutations in CD79A have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly the activated B-cell-like subtype (PMID: 20054396), suggesting that CD79A acts as an oncogene. Such aberrations result in increased BCR signaling and ligand-independent clustering of BCRs, resulting in enhanced B-cell survival and differentiation. Antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD79A/B and inhibitors targeting SRC activity, such as dasatinib, can reduce BCR signaling (PMID: 17374736, 20054396).	false

CD79B is a surface immunoglobulin that forms a complex with CD79A to form a component of the B-cell receptor (BCR) (PMID:1439759). The CD79 (Iga/Igb) complex is important for signaling from the BCR to support maturation and survival of B-cells throughout development (PMID:15186779, 8602530). The cytoplasmic portion of CD79B contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) domains that become phosphorylated by SRC proto-oncogene family protein kinases. These regions serve as docking sites for signaling complex formation with kinases such as SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) and for signal regulation (PMID: 17114463, 20940318, 22078222). Activating mutations of CD79B have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly the activated B-cell-like subtype (PMID: 20054396) suggesting that CD79B acts as an oncogene. CD79B mutations result in increased surface BCR expression, reduced BCR internalization and dampening of LYN (Lyn proto-oncogene) kinase feedback inhibition, thus resulting in increased BCR signaling. Somatic mutation in the protein's ITAM domain have also been identified and shown to affect signaling (PMID: 20054396). Germline CD79B mutation leads to agammaglobulinemia, a severe immunodeficiency syndrome with B-cell dysfunction (PMID: 17709424). Antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD79B and inhibitors targeting SRC activity, such as dasatinib, can reduce BCR signaling (PMID: 17374736, 20054396, 25925619, 28009435).	false

CDC42 is a small GTPase that localizes to the plasma membrane of the cell. CDC42 can switch between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, transducing signals to a variety of downstream effectors (PMID: 21115489). CDC42 plays a role in cell polarization, chemotaxis, migration and mitosis (PMID: 14978216, 15642749, 17038317, 26689677). In cancer, CDC42 overexpression has been associated with enhanced proliferation and invasion, suggesting an oncogenic role; however, a tumor suppressor function related to cell polarity maintenance has also been observed (PMID: 21515363). Mutations and copy number alterations of CDC42 are rare events in cancer. CDC42, as well as other Rho GTPases (e.g., Ras oncoproteins), are difficult targets for pharmacological intervention, although some CDC42-specific drugs exist (PMID: 21433396).	false

CDC73 (also known as HRPT2) is the nuclear parafibromin protein, a component of the RNA Polymerase-associated factor (PAF1) complex which regulates transcriptional elongation, histone methylation and histone ubiquitination to modulate gene expression (PMID: 20178742, 19522828, 12667454). The PAF1 complex, composed of CDC73, CTR9, LEO1, RTF1, SKI8, and PAF1, associates with the RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A (PMID: 19522828). CDC73 is a tumor suppressor, and germline mutations are associated with familial hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome (PMID:12434154, 15531515), while somatic mutations are found in parathyroid carcinomas (PMID: 14585940, 12960210).

CDH1, also known as E-cadherin, is a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that is mainly expressed in epithelial cells and functions in cell-cell adhesion, signaling cascades and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PMID: 18726070). The extracellular portion of E-cadherin facilitates homophilic cell-to-cell adhesion by binding to cadherins on adjacent cells, while the intracellular domain is tethered to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with catenins and functions to activate signaling cascades that play a role in the EMT (PMID:7885471, 2788574). The transcription factor SNAIL, a key regulator of the EMT during embryonic development, represses expression of the E-cadherin gene in tumor cell lines (PMID: 10655586, 10655587). Lack of E-cadherin function/expression enables cancer progression by altering cellular morphology, decreasing cellular adhesion, and increasing cellular motility (PMID: 10439038, 2070412, 9515965). Along with point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation of the CDH1 promoter has been associated with the loss of E-cadherin gene expression during cancer progression (PMID: 7543680). Individuals with a germline CDH1 mutation have an increased risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer and breast cancer (PMID: 11729114). Loss of E-cadherin has also been demonstrated in a variety of sporadic cancer types including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer (PMID: 11313896, 22716209, 21373750).	true

CDK12 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 12) is a kinase involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and the regulation of transcriptional elongation of many DNA-damage-response genes (PMID: 11683387, 22012619). Recurrent inactivating CDK12 mutations in metastatic prostate and serous ovarian cancers have been observed (PMID: 28843286, PMID: 26787835). CDK12 interacts with and phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP) in vitro (PMID: 11683387) and complexes with Cyclin K to maintain genomic stability via regulation of the expression of DNA damage response genes, such as BRCA1, ATR, FANCI and FANCD2. Loss of the CDK12/cyclin K complex renders HEK293 cells sensitive to various DNA damaging agents, including camptothecin, etoposide and mitomycin C (PMID: 22012619, 24662513). CDK12 is one of the most frequently somatically mutated genes in ovarian cancer (PMID: 21720365), which is consistent with its role in the maintenance of genomic stability. The genomic location of CDK12, is adjacent to that of ERBB2, and while there is some laboratory data that associates an amplification of CDK12 to a tumorigenic phenotype (PMID: 28187285, 27880910, 28334900), it is likely that CDK12 amplification is a passenger event in this context, co-occurring with ERBB2 amplification in breast and gastric cancers (PMID: 20932292, 21097718, 26658019).	true

CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the cell cycle G1 to S phase transition. Upon mitogen stimulation, CDK4 forms a complex with cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), which leads to activation of the kinases (PMID: 12432268). The active CDK4/CDK6 complex then phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (RB), thereby inducing the gene expression program regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors, which is important in cell cycle progression. CDK4/6 are in turn negatively regulated by p16INK4a (CDKN2A), which binds to the catalytic domains of the kinases and interferes with cyclin D and ATP binding (PMID: 9751050, 11124804).

CDK8 (cyclin-dependent kinase 8) is a serine/threonine kinase that is an important regulator of DNA transcription and cell cycle progression. CDK8 associates with Cyclin C (CCNC), Med12 and Med13 to form a module that associates with the Mediator complex, which is involved in the regulation of DNA transcription (PMID: 7568034). CDK8 associates and phosphorylates the c-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, and thus plays an important role in transcriptional elongation (PMID:10023686, 11278802). CDK8 is a positive regulator of oncogene-induced proliferation and enables efficient transcriptional elongation through recruitment of pTEF-B and BRD4 to oncogenic genes (PMID: 20098423). However, CDK8 has been shown to restrain Mediator-dependent super-enhancer driven transcription in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 26416749), and thus may have different roles in certain oncogenic contexts.

The CDKN1A gene encodes the p21 (WAF1) protein, which is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. p21 inhibits the cyclin-dependent kinases CDC2 and CDK2, leading to G1 phase cell cycle arrest. p21 expression is upregulated by DNA damage through a p53-dependent mechanism (PMID: 8242752). Moreover, activation of the PI3K/AKT mitogenic signaling pathway results in phosphorylation and localization of p21 to the cytoplasm where it can no longer access its CDK targets, leading to enhanced cell proliferation. p21 may play a role in repair of DNA damage through interactions with DNA polymerase accessory factors. Loss of p21 can lead to chromosomal aneuploidy, implying a role in mitotic regulation. p21 expression is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and protein levels: tumor suppressors and oncoproteins modulate transcription of CDKN1A while post-translational p21 modification regulates proteasomal degradation and subcellular localization (PMID: 9296497, 10319992). The majority of p21 alterations in cancer are truncating, concurrent with its role as a tumor suppressor, and p21 knockout mouse models display an increased incidence of a variety of cancers as compared to mice with intact p21 expression (PMID: 7664346, 12810620). p21 also exhibits anti-apoptotic activity in certain contexts, suggesting that it also possesses an oncogenic role.

CDKN1B (cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor 1B), also called p27 or KIP1, is a member of the Cip/Kip protein family and helps control cell cycle progression, proliferation, motility, and apoptosis (PMID: 18354415). The p27 protein is ubiquitously expressed and located both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (PMID: 8033212). Nuclear p27 functions as a tumor suppressor by controlling cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, specifically by inhibiting the binding of cyclins A and E to CDK2 (PMID: 18354415). Conversely, cytoplasmic p27 may have a pro-oncogenic role by stimulating cell migration through mechanisms largely independent of its CDK-inhibiting function (PMID: 15573116, 17909030). The activity of p27 is largely regulated by protein degradation, and proteolysis is triggered by its CDK-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination by SCF complexes (PMID: 16633365). Germline mutations in p27 can cause a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome (PMID: 17030811). Low p27 levels due to increased protein degradation are prevalent in several different types of epithelial tumors, such as cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, skin, hematopoietic malignancies, gliomas, and sarcomas, and are commonly correlated with aggressive tumor growth and poor clinical outcome (PMID: 15573116, 10699961).	true

The CDKN2A gene encodes two unique proteins, p16(Ink4a) and p14(ARF), which are important in regulating cell cycle progression (PMID: 8521522). p16(Ink4a) is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, which inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 by preventing their binding to cyclins. This activates the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins, which blocks the G1 to S-phase transition and can result in cell cycle arrest or quiescence (PMID: 15878778, 22025288). p14(ARF) is an inhibitor of MDM2-mediated degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, thus enhancing p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis (PMID: 9529249). Deletion of CDKN2A in murine models results in the generation of spontaneous tumors, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 8620534). The CDKN2A locus is also frequently mutated or epigenetically silenced in numerous cancer types, including lymphoma, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer (PMID: 27428416).

CDKN2B (cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor 2B), also known as p15 or INK4B, is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that helps regulate cell cycle progression. p15 inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 by preventing their binding to cyclins. This activates the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins, which blocks the G1 to S-phase transition and can result in cell cycle arrest or quiescence (PMID: 9031081). CDKN2B expression has also been shown to regulate TGFÎ²-mediated cell cycle arrest (PMID: 8078588). Germline mutations in CDKN2B can result in a predisposition to renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 25873077). Deletion of CDKN2B in murine models can result in tumor progression, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 14681685) and it is frequently deleted, hypermethylated, or mutated in a variety of tumors (PMID: 9479825).	true

CDKN2C (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C), also known as p18 or INK4C, is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that helps regulate cell cycle progression. p18 inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 by preventing their binding to cyclins. This activates the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of proteins, which blocks the G1 to S-phase transition and can result in cell cycle arrest or quiescence (PMID: 9031081). Regulation of cell division by p18 is important for B-cell, muscle and cerebellar development (PMID: 21163929, 9528803, 16864777). Consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor, deletions and mutations of p18 are found in multiple cancer types including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, glioblastoma, meningiomas and pituitary cancer (PMID:16960149, 18829482, 18381405, 11485924, 18973139).	true

CEBPA is a transcription factor that is a member of the basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) protein family (PMID: 25753223). CEBPA exists as two isoforms (p42 and p30) and binds DNA as a homodimer or heterodimer (as a p42/p30 heterodimer or in complex with other transcription factors, such as AP-1) to activate transcription (PMID: 25753223, 18026136). Through interactions via the transactivation domain, CEBPA can help recruit RNA polymerase II, coactivators such as CBP (Creb binding protein)/p300, and chromatin-modifying complexes such as SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) (PMID: 12857754, 14660596). CEBPA functions as a regulator of cellular identity and coordinates the differentiation of diverse cell types including hematopoietic, adipose, and epithelial cells (PMID: 7652557, 23160954, 12757710). In hematopoiesis, CEBPA is important for the development of the myeloid lineage and granulocytic differentiation by regulating specific growth factor receptors and cell cycle arrest (PMID: 25753223). Loss of CEBPA in several cell types results in aberrant gene expression changes and cancer progression (PMID: 17638888). CEBPA mutations are found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in inherited AML predisposition syndromes (PMID: 11242107, 12351377, 25311743, 23560626). N-terminal alterations result in the exclusive expression of the CEBPA p30 isoform and commonly co-occur with biallelic C-terminal mutations that disrupt CEBPA homodimerization (PMID: 31309149). Biallelic CEBPA mutations are predictive of a favorable outcome in patients with AML (PMID: 19171880) and result in the activation of CD73, which promotes immune evasion (PMID: 31309149).	true

CENPA is a histone variant that replaces the canonical histone H3 protein in nucleosomes at centromeres (PMID: 3558482, 20739937, 21478274, 16622419). Centromeric chromatin has distinct properties including flexible histone tails, which preclude the binding of histone H1, a histone molecule important in heterochromatin formation (PMID: 27499292, 32516549). CENPA is only present at centromeres and is essential for the correct assembly of proteins at the kinetochore, for centromere activity, and for chromosome segregation (PMID: 12906131, 10655499, 15870271, 27499292). Impaired kinetochore assembly and centromere activity can lead to aneuploidy and the development of cancer (PMID: 15380953). In addition, CENPA controls epigenetic mechanisms important for centromere organization, DNA replication, and cell division (PMID: 17339380, 9024683). Overexpression of CENPA is found in many cancer types including hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma, among others (PMID: 17535684, 12839935, 26295306, 32371391). Amplification and overexpression of CENPA is a marker of poor prognosis, including in patients with breast cancer and osteosarcoma (PMID: 17970049, 24213134, 24440098, 24676531, 22369099). Somatic mutations in CENPA have been identified; however, these alterations have not been functionally validated (PMID: 31337617). Downregulation of CENPA contributes to methotrexate resistance and doxorubicin-induced senescence induced by low doses of doxorubicin in cancer cell lines (PMID: 26337976, 15870702).	false

CHD2, a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family, encodes for a chromodomain helicase that functions in chromatin remodeling (PMID: 9326634, 25384982). CHD2 is composed of two chromodomains at the N-terminus that serve an autoinhibitory role for DNA-binding and ATPase activities (PMID: 25384982). CHD2 modifies chromatin through remodeling to regulate gene expression related to cellular development and differentiation (PMID: 25621013, 28549158). Expression of inactivating CHD2 mutations in cancer cell lines induces increased activation of signaling pathways associated with DNA modification processes, suggesting that CHD2 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 26031915). Loss of CHD2 function has been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 26031915, 31774495, 31527074).	true

CHD4, a member of the SNF2/RAD54 helicase family, encodes for a helicase that functions in remodeling nucleosome structure through the ATPase/helicase domain of the protein (PMID: 8843877). CHD4 is a core component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which regulates chromatin structure, gene expression and cell cycle progression (PMID: 11410659, 20693977). CHD4 has also been identified to regulate cellular processes independent of the NuRD complex, which include DNA-damage response, cell cycle progression and signal transduction, through binding to histone H3 with the PHD finger motifs of CHD4 (PMID: 15189737, 20805324, 22749909). Knockdown of CHD4 in various cancer cell lines and models inhibits cellular proliferation and invasion and decreases tumor metastasis, suggesting that CHD4 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 32070428, 32228507, 36681835). Amplification of CHD4 has been identified in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, uterine serous carcinoma and oral cancer (PMID: 33994851, 23359684, 28683324).

In response to DNA damage, CHEK1 is activated by the kinases ATR and ATM via phosphorylation (PMID: 12781359). Once activated, CHEK1 acts as an effector kinase, mediating downstream signaling that leads to a diverse range of cellular responses, including cell cycle checkpoint activation, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and/or apoptosis and replication fork stability (PMID: 23508805). In particular, activated CHEK1 maintains the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex in an inactive cytoplasmic state, which prevents the G2/M transition and prevents mitotic segregation of damaged chromatids (PMID: 21532626). Though CHEK1 mutations are extremely rare (PMID: 12781359) CHEK1 is frequently over-expressed in a variety of tumors, including breast (PMID: 17638866), non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 24418519 ), and nasopharyngeal cancers (PMID: 15297395).	true

The CHTF8 gene, also known as DERPC, encodes the CTF8 subunit of the CTF18 replication factor C (RFC) complex, a proliferating cell nuclear antigen loader that functions in sister chromatid cohesion (PMID: 20826785). CTF8, along with the subunits CTF18 and DCC1, form a trimeric complex to mediate binding to DNA polymerase Îµ to promote polymorphic modulation of DNA synthesis (PMID: 20826785). Deletion of CHTF8 by itself and in combination with the other subunits of the RFC complex in yeast demonstrate severe defects in sister chromatid cohesion and G2/M cell cycle accumulation (PMID: 11389843). In vitro studies with prostate tumor cell lines and kidney embryonic cell lines demonstrate that CHTF8 expression is significantly reduced in prostate and renal cancer, respectively (PMID: 12477976). Similarly, overexpression of CHTF8 in prostate tumor cell lines demonstrates prostate cancer growth suppression as measured by inhibition of colony growth (PMID: 12477976).	true

CIC (also Capicua) is a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the high mobility (HMG)-box protein family (PMID: 32073140). CIC is expressed in a variety of tissues and is a critical regulator of patterning, differentiation, and signaling (PMID: 10652276, 32073140). Chromatin modifiers, such as the Sin/HDAC3 histone deacetylase complex, are recruited to sites bound by CIC to inhibit gene expression of target genes (PMID: 29844126). CIC exists in diverse protein complexes including with ATXN1, which directly binds CIC and modulates its transcriptional repressor activity (PMID: 17190598). The CIC-ATXN1 complex regulates the expression of several transcription factors, including members of the ETS protein family (PMID: 27869830). Loss of CIC expression results in the derepression of ETS transcriptional regulators, such as ETV4, which can activate extracellular remodeling programs and metastasis (PMID: 27869830, 22014525). In addition, CIC is a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and MAPK signaling pathways and acts as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of RTK signaling (PMID: 11714680, 11861482, 29844126, 28178529). CIC is recurrently mutated in oligodendrogliomas, including in 1p/19q-deleted cancers (PMID: 21817013, 22869205, 22588899). Somatic mutations and deletions have also been found in various other cancer types, including in lung and gastric cancers (PMID: 25079317, 27869830). Chromosomal translocations that produce chimeric CIC proteins fused to several partner proteins, including DUX4 or FOXO4, occur in aggressive round cell sarcomas and result in aberrant CIC-mediated transcriptional activation (PMID: 19837261, 25007147, 21813156).	true

CIITA is a transcriptional coactivator that functions as a master regulator of the genes that encode the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) proteins (PMID: 24391648). MHC class II proteins present extracellular peptides on the surface of antigen presenting cells to display these peptides to the immune system. CIITA is constitutively expressed in cell types that express MHC class II molecules, including dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells (PMID: 25324123). CIITA and MHC class II expression can be induced in other immune cell types by IFNÎ³ and stimulation with other cytokines (PMID: 25324123). CIITA has multifaceted roles in transcriptional regulation including replacement of the TFIID component in the general transcriptional complex as well as acetyltransferase and kinase activity, which are necessary for the transcription of MHC class I and class II genes (PMID: 24391648). CIITA requires the DNA binding proteins CREB, RFX, and NF-Y to serve as a binding scaffold (PMID: 16730065). Germline mutations in CIITA have been identified in patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II, an immune deficiency that leads to a loss of MHC class II protein surface expression (PMID: 7749985). Rearrangements involving CIITA are found in patients with B cell and Hodgkin lymphoma (PMID: 21368758). CIITA fusion proteins cause downregulation of MHC class II expression and overexpression of ligands for PD-1, a receptor that mediates immune suppression (PMID: 21368758). Somatic CIITA loss-of-function mutations and deletions have been associated with some lymphomas, suggesting that CIITA functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 28479318, 26599546, 26549456).	true

The 5â cap of mRNA is modified by methylation on both the first and second nucleotide, which is important for effective processing, translation initiation, gene expression, splicing, and stability of mRNA (PMID: 24402442, 15525712). In addition, 2'-O-ribose methylation is important for immune recognition of mRNA transcripts in the host cell (PMID: 21217758). Cap2 methylation occurs on fifty percent of mRNA transcripts, while methylation of the first nucleotide is ubiquitous of all mRNA (PMID: 1057180, 21310715).

In leukemias, CREBBP can be disrupted by translocations that fuse the HAT domain with the MOZ/KAT6A (lysine acetyltransferase 6a) protein t(8;16) (PMID: 9447825). Somatic mutations of CREBBP have been found in leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors including small-cell lung cancer, squamous carcinoma and bladder cancer (PMID: 24670651, 21796119, 21390130, 25151357, 21390130). Most CREBBP mutations are truncating and commonly co-occur with loss of the wildtype allele, suggesting that CREBBP is a tumor suppressor. Inherited mutations can result in the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome with stereotypical facial and digit abnormalities along with neurological deficits (PMID:7630403). CREBBP-mutated tumors are dependent on EP300 activity and inhibitors targeting EP300 are efficacious in CREBBP-mutated cell line and mouse models (PMID: 26603525).	true

CRKL is an adaptor protein that facilitates signal transduction from kinases to downstream targets (PMID:10648385). It is a target of the BCR-ABL translocation kinase and enhances transformation in CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia) (PMID:20807813). CRKL can activate the Ras, Rac, and Jun kinase signaling pathways (PMID:12393632, 11443118, 10514505). Pathway activation mediates diverse cellular processes involved in cancer including cell proliferation, EMT (epithelial to mesenchymal transition), and invasion (PMID:26044596, 25661331,25318601). CRKL amplification has been identified in lung carcinomas and gastric cancer (PMID:22591714, 22586683). Amplification can be a means of acquired resistance to targeted therapy in EGFR lung cancer (PMID:22586683).	false

CRLF2 is a type I cytokine receptor that signals through the pro-oncogenic JAK-STAT pathway, which regulates processes such as proliferation and development of the hematopoietic system (PMID: 20807819). In order to signal, CRLF2 heterodimerizes with the IL7RA (interleukin 7 receptor), thus forming the receptor for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine that mediates B-cell precursor proliferation and survival (PMID: 9916685). CRLF2 is expressed on T cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and basophils (PMID: 11418668). Its activation is linked to a Th2 response, can lead to eosinophilia, and is implicated in reactivity and airway remodeling for asthma, in atopic dermatitis, and in immunity against helminth infections (PMID: 24167583, 26288354, 21841801, 23024277 ). Rearrangement of the gene is seen in precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25207766, 22897847, 19838194). Rearranged receptor can signal through the JAK-STAT and PI3K-MTOR pathways and lead to transformation (PMID: 22685175, 19838194).	false

CSDE1 (also UNR) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates RNA stability and protein homeostasis (PMID: 31987048, 29422612). CSDE1 forms complexes with diverse partner proteins to positively or negatively regulate cap-dependent translation, cap-independent translation, and mRNA transcript stability (PMID: 17086213, 31987048). The binding of CSDE1 regulates numerous mRNA targets, including poly(A) binding protein (PABP), MYC and FOS (PMID: 16356927, 31027221). Because CSDE1 is involved in numerous RNA regulatory protein complexes, CSDE1 modulates a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis, neuronal development, cell cycle progression, invasion and sex chromosome dosage compensation (PMID: 31579823, 24012837, 17159903, 11313462). In addition, CSDE1 regulates processes important in protein translation including deadenylation (PMID: 11051545, 15314026). Loss-of-function mutations in CSDE1 have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (PMID: 31579823). Deletions and loss-of-function alterations have been identified in patients with rare neuroendocrine tumors, including pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PMID: 28162975). In addition, CSDE1 may function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in several cancer types (PMID: 31027221, 27908735, 28162975, 29422612).	false	
ENST00000286301	NM_005211.3	ENST00000286301	NM_005211.3	1436	CSF1R	false			CSF1R, a cytokine receptor, is altered in various cancer types.	CSF1R is a membrane protein that acts as a receptor for colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), a cytokine that regulates the production, differentiation, and function of macrophages. CSF1R-mediated signaling is an important regulator of innate immunity. Co-expression of CSF1R and the ligand CSF1 can lead to tumorigenic activity in cancer cells independent of CSF1R overexpression or amplification, suggesting that CSF1R acts as an oncogene (PMID: 22096574). However, loss-of-function CSF1R mutations and splice variants have also been associated with a predisposition for myeloid malignancies (PMID: 18971950). Kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies that target CSF1R have been shown to effectively target CSF1/CSF1R signaling, resulting in a reduction in the number of tumor-associated macrophages. Experimental data suggest that CSF1/CSF1R blockade could improve the efficacy of immunotherapies by enhancing activation of T cells in the tumor microenvironment.

CSF3R (also G-CSF) is a transmembrane receptor for cytokine colony-stimulating factor 3. Activation of the receptor is associated with the increased production of neutrophilic granulocytes and has been used clinically to shorten recovery time for chemotherapy and to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells into the periphery for stem cell collection (PMID: 7521686, 3311216, 7534140). Signaling from the receptor is mediated by JAK (Janus kinase) and SRC (SRC proto-oncogene) family of kinases with downstream activation of STAT, PI3K, and MAPK signaling cascades (PMID:7579336, 9590246) and inhibition mediated through the SOCS (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling) proteins and tyrosine phosphatases (PMID:12133942, 9590246). Loss of function mutations can lead to severe congenital neutropenia (PMID:10449521, 24753537). Activating mutations can cause receptor dimerization independent of ligand with mutations near the juxtamembrane region, or truncate the receptor leading to altered signal transduction (PMID:23739288, 8246993). These mutations have been found in myeloid disorders such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 7542747, 23656643). Solid tumors have been shown to express CSF3R that may be important for disease phenotype or transformation (PMID:16912178, 25908586).	false	
ENST00000264010	NM_006565.3	ENST00000264010	NM_006565.3	10664	CTCF	false			CTCF, a tumor suppressor and chromatin binding factor, is mutated in various cancers, most frequently in endometrial cancer.	CTCF is a versatile regulator of gene transcription that binds DNA with different combinations of its eleven highly conserved zinc finger (ZF) domains. CTCF can recruit histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs), along with other cofactors, and activate or repress transcription, respectively (PMID: 11525835,10734189). The c-MYC oncogene is a well-known CTCF target, which acts in this context as a transcriptional repressor (PMID: 8649389). CTCF also acts as an insulator, playing a role in high order chromatin structural organization and long-range genomic interactions (PMID: 23498937), typically isolating enhancers from promoters which ultimately results in inhibition of gene transcription (PMID: 19846290, 25002401). Insulation is achieved by CTCF-mediated modification of epigenetic marks, such as H3K27me3 removal (PMID: 25294833). CTCF binding prevents CpG methylation and vice versa (PMID: 20591991, 25703332). While complete loss of CTCF is embryonically lethal, CTCF haploinsufficiency has been demonstrated to alter global methylation patterns, predispose mice to a range of cancers and is associated with shortened overall lifespan (PMID: 24794443). Mutations in the CTCF gene usually result in a truncated protein, and they are mainly found in carcinomas of the endometrium (15%), digestive tract (colon and stomach, around 5%) and breast (cBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2015). In addition, both CTCF loss and overexpression lead to global effects in expression profiles.	true	
ENST00000302823	NM_005214.4	ENST00000648405	NM_005214.4	1493	CTLA4	true			CTLA4, a transmembrane receptor, is infrequently altered in cancer and is a promising target for immune blockade therapies.	CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4) is a transmembrane immunoglobulin receptor that blocks activation of T-lymphocytes (PMID: 9653097). CTLA4 binds to ligand B7-1 and B7-2, present on antigen presenting cells (PMID: 7543139). Binding of these ligands prevents their binding to CD28, the co-stimulatory molecule on T-cells and transduces an inhibitory signal within the T-cell (PMID: 11244047). Germline mutations in CTLA4 lead to immune dysregulation, hyper-activated T-cells and loss of normal circulating B-cells (PMID: 25213377). Polymorphisms and mutations in CTLA4 are associated with autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disorders and diabetes (PMID: 25695113, 25329329). Inhibition of CTLA4 has been employed in immune therapy of cancer by allowing activation of tumor-specific T-cells (PMID: 20525992). Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CTLA4, is FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and functions by inhibiting immune system tolerance. Combination treatments with other immunotherapy treatments, including nivolumab, are currently under investigation (PMID: 28087644).	false	
ENST00000302763	NM_001903	ENST00000302763	NM_001903	1495	CTNNA1	false			CTNNA1, a cytoplasmic adhesion protein, is infrequently altered in cancer.	CTNNA1 encodes for a catenin which functions in association with a variety of cadherins to promote cell-adhesion (PMID: 11997091). The intracellular adhesion function of CTNNA1 is regulated through a dual-kinase mechanism located on the carboxy-terminal region and phospho-linker region of the protein (PMID: 25653389). CTNNA1 forms part of the E-cadherin/catenin multiprotein complex and promotes adhesion junction through interaction between other catenins and the actin cytoskeleton (PMID: 34425242, 9819562). Inactivation of CTNNA1 in various types of cancer cell lines and models induces cellular invasiveness and tumor metastasis, suggesting that CTNNA1 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 33057364, 17223851, 29484367, 33364826). Downregulation of CTNNA1 has been identified in various types of cancer, including bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer (PMID: 18190825, 25177364, 22080244).	true	
ENST00000349496	NM_001904.3	ENST00000349496	NM_001904.3	1499	CTNNB1	true			CTNNB1 (Î²-catenin), a transcriptional activator, is recurrently mutated in various cancers including endometrial and hepatocellular cancers.	CTNNB1 (also Î²-catenin) is a transcriptional activator involved in the WNT signaling pathway (PMID: 22682243, 22617422). In the absence of WNT ligands, Î²-catenin is sequestered in the cytosol by its interaction with the APC/AXIN destruction complex. This destruction complex includes GSK3Î², a kinase responsible for phosphorylating key Î²-catenin residues and targeting Î²-catenin for degradation. Engagement of WNT receptors by WNT ligands results in disruption of the APC/AXIN destruction complex, freeing Î²-catenin to transit into the nucleus and mediate target gene activation by interaction with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family. Important transcriptional targets of Î²-catenin/TCF include Cyclin D1 and MYC (PMID: 10201372, 9727977). Î²-catenin also influences cell-cell adhesion and cell migration (PMID: 15001769). Somatic gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1 result in aberrant accumulation of the Î²-catenin protein and are prevalent in a wide range of solid tumors, including uterine/endometrial carcinoma (PMID: 9721853, 23636398), ovarian (PMID: 19349352, 20942669), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 22634756, 23788652), and colorectal carcinoma (PMID: 22810696), among others. Cancers with CTNNB1 mutations are presumed to be resistant to pharmacologic inhibition of upstream components of the WNT pathway, instead requiring direct inhibition of Î²-catenin function (PMID: 19351922, 22682243).	false	
ENST00000361367	NM_014633.4	ENST00000361367	NM_014633.4	9646	CTR9	false			CTR9, a component of the PAF1 complex involved in RNA polymerase II regulation, is recurrently altered by mutation in Wilms tumor.	CTR9 is an adaptor protein that is a component of the transcriptional regulatory PAF1 complex (PAF1c) (PMID: 20060942). CTR9 binds the multimeric PAF1c, which is also composed of the proteins PAF1, LEO1, CDC73, RTF1, and WDR61 (PMID: 25099282, 11884586, 30228257). PAF1c binds RNA polymerase II (Pol II) via the C-terminal domain (CTD) in the unphosphorylated state and dynamically regulates transcription at various stages including initiation, termination, elongation, and polyadenylation (PMID: 25099282, 11884586). In addition to regulating the activity of Pol II, PAF1c and CTR9 function to recruit transcription factors, histone remodelers, and processing factors to chromatin, thereby regulating gene expression via various layers of regulation (PMID: 20060942). The activity of CTR9 and PAF1c coordinate the appropriate placement of histone marks, allowing for regulation of chromatin remodeling (PMID: 22982193). The PAF1c complex also mediates the eviction of Pol II from chromatin in response to DNA damage, implicating the transcriptional complex in mediating genome instability (PMID: 26798134). PAF1c function is ubiquitously expressed to coordinate gene expression; however, PAF1c activity is particularly important during development (PMID: 17721442) and for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity (PMID: 19345177). Germline mutations in CTR9 are found in patients with Wilmsâ tumor, a childhood renal cancer (PMID: 25099282). CTR9 alterations are predominantly heterozygous and alter CTR9 splicing, likely leading to protein truncation and loss of activity, suggesting that CTR9 acts predominantly as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 25099282, 29292210). However, in breast cancer, CTR9 expression is associated with increased transcription of oncogenic genes and proliferation, demonstrating a context-specific growth-promoting role of CTR9 (PMID: 26494790, 27829357).	true

CUL3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the cullin protein family (PMID: 27200299). Cullins, such as CUL3, associate with RING domain proteins to form E3 ligase complexes, which covalently attach ubiquitin to target proteins for subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome (PMID: 15071497). CUL3 functions as a scaffolding protein with BTB-domain adaptor proteins to bring target substrates in proximity to the catalytic RING domain (PMID: 17120193). CUL3 is also involved in many cellular processes including the maturation of endosomes associated with lysosomal degradation, inflammation, proliferation, and cell cycle progression (PMID: 22219362, 30872636, 27200299). In addition, CUL3 interacts with several substrate adaptors that are altered in cancer including KEAP1, KLHL20, and SPOP (PMID: 27200299). A prominent example is KEAP1, which recruits the oxidative stress signaling factor NRF2 to the CUL3-containing E3-ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation (PMID: 19321346, 19638449, 23365135). Germline mutations in CUL3 are found in patients with Gordonâs syndrome, which is characterized by hypertension (PMID: 23689903). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in CUL3 have been identified in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 31548347). These alterations disrupt the degradation of NRF2 and subsequently upregulate the oxidative stress response via KEAP1 and NRF2, leading to cancer progression (PMID: 19321346, 19638449, 23365135).	true

CUL4 encodes for the ubiquitin ligase component of the cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (PMID: 15811626, 16678110). The cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex mediates ubiquitination of target proteins in response to DNA damage and regulates histone methylation (PMID: 15448697, 16678110, 17041588). Overexpression of CUL4 in various cancer cell lines and models induces metastasis, tumor growth and cellular proliferation, suggesting that CUL4 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 28576144, 25413624, 28223829). CUL4 amplification has been identified in various types of cancer, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer (PMID: 34119472, 22422151, 24305877). CUL4 expression is a potential therapeutic target with preclinical studies investigating the efficacy of anti-CUL4 inhibitors in various types of cancer (PMID: 28677427, 33602808). CUL4 is suggested to confer chemoresistance in ovarian cancer by inhibiting BIRC3 expression (PMID: 30718461).	false

CUX1 (also CUTL1) is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in a variety of cellular contexts (PMID: 18313863). The CUX1 protein has several alternative spliced protein isoforms which exhibit distinct DNA binding and transcriptional properties (PMID: 12429822). One isoform of CUX1 can function as either a transcriptional repressor or activator, while another is critical in base excision repair (PMID: 25190083). CUX1 also binds at enhancer sites with cohesin and regulates higher-order chromatin structure (PMID: 28369554). In addition, CUX1 regulates key cellular functions including cell cycle, proliferation, migration, neutrophil maturation, DNA damage and TGF-Î²-mediated signaling (PMID: 11438745, 22319212, 28147323, 18313863). Loss of CUX1 in preclinical models results in various gene expression changes, including de-repression of the PI3K pathway inhibitor PIK3IP1, leading to hematopoietic abnormalities (PMID: 29592892). CUX1 is recurrently deleted in uterine leiomyomas, acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (PMID: 9178912, 23212519, 25645650). Deletion of CUX1 occurs in the commonly deleted 7q region and is typically heterozygous, suggesting that CUX1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor (PMID: 23212519, 25645650). Somatic loss-of-function mutations and fusion proteins involving CUX1 are also found in a range of human cancers, namely hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 21674579). While CUX1 can function as a tumor suppressor in some cancer types, increased expression of CUX1 is also transforming in preclinical models and overexpression of CUX1 has been linked to poor prognosis in several human cancers (PMID: 25190083).	true

CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor specific to the stromal-derived factor CXCL12, a molecule with potent chemotactic activity for lymphocytes (PMID: 20484021). Through autocrine and paracrine interactions, the CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling axis promotes cancer cell proliferation, survival, motility and drug resistance (PMID: 20484021). Expression of CXCR4 in cancer cells has been linked to metastasis to tissues containing high levels of CXCL12, like the bone, lungs, liver and lymph nodes (PMID: 21866172, 20484021, 17891505, 11242036). The CXCR4-CXCL12 axis also induces angiogenesis in several malignancies through hypoxia-induced CXCR4 expression and recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells to tumors (PMID: 15180966, 15882617, 21618540). Germline mutations in CXCR4, including activating C-terminal truncating mutations, cause WHIM syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by neutropenia (Abstract: Cao et al. Abstract# 2715, ASH 2012. http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/120/21/2715)(PMID: 24553177, 24711662). Somatic alterations in CXCR4 are found in WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia (PMID: 24553177), but are rare in other cancers; elevated expression of CXCR4 is a poor prognostic marker in many cancers, including breast, ovarian, melanoma and prostate cancers (PMID: 25669980). Inhibitors of the CXCL4-CXCL12 axis are in several Phase I/II clinical trials for stem cell mobilization and HIV research; these inhibitors have not yet been evaluated in the context of cancer (PMID: 24141062).	false

Germline mutations of CYLD are associated with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, familial cylindromas, multiple familial tricoepithelioma, and spiradenomas.	CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes lysine-63-linked ubiquitin marks. It negatively regulates NF-ÎºB signaling by deubiquitinating upstream regulators such as TRAF2 and TRAF6 (PMID: 12917689, 12917691). CYLD has a tumor suppressor role, principally via NF-ÎºB pathway inhibition and enhancement of apoptosis (PMID: 12917690). Despite its recognized tumor suppressor role, CYLD also modulates microtubule dynamics and plays roles in cell migration and angiogenesis (PMID: 18222923, 20194890). CYLD is involved in other physiological processes, such as immune response, inflammation, cell cycle progression, spermatogenesis and osteoclastogenesis (PMID: 19373246). CYLD is mutated at low frequencies in various tumors. Around 25% of CYLD alterations are truncating mutations (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Jan. 2017). Germline mutations in CYLD gene have been associated with cylindromatosis, multiple familial trichoepithelioma, and Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (PMID: 26370355, 20502185, 16307661, 26329847).	true

Germline mutations in CYP19A1 are found in aromatase excess and deficiency syndromes.	CYP19A1 (also aromatase) is an enzyme that is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (PMID: 11826265). CYP19A1 mediates the conversion of androgen precursors into estrogens, a hormone that functions in reproductive processes as well as in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (PMID: 11826265). Estrogens bind to estrogen receptors (ER), which dimerize in the nucleus to regulate ER-responsive transcription and chromatin states (PMID: 29259445, 29775582, 22049316). The expression of CYP19A1 is highly context-dependent and is controlled by ten distinct tissue-specific promoters (PMID: 23340254). CYP19A1 is predominantly produced in the ovary in premenopausal, non-pregnant women; however, CYP19A1 production shifts to peripheral tissues, such as adipose, bone and skin tissues, following menopause (PMID: 11826265). Germline mutations in CYP19A1 result in aromatase excess and deficiency syndromes, which can result in early puberty, breast hypertrophy, and abnormal virilization (PMID: 12736278, 8530621). Patients with ER+ (estrogen receptor-positive) breast cancers may receive adjuvant endocrine therapy which may include aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole, exemestane, and anastrozole (PMID: 14668813). Several mechanisms of aromatase-based resistance have been identified, including amplification and mutation of CYP19A1 in patients with ER+ breast cancers (PMID: 14668813, 28112739, 24242068). CYP19A1 activity has also been implicated in several other hormone-positive cancers including endometrial cancers and cholangiocarcinomas (PMID: 27067638, 30284180).	false

CYSTLTR2 is activated by cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), which are inflammatory lipid mediators that are involved in allergic processes (PMID: 16776669, 13679572). Activation of GÎ±q proteins (such as GNAQ and GNA11) by CYSLTR2 promotes GÎ±q-mediated GDP/GTP exchange and binding to phospholipase C Î² (PLCB4), resulting in PIP2 cleavage (PMID: 27089179). Following PIP2 cleavage, the second messenger proteins diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) activate calcium release (PMID: 27089179). CYSLTR2-mediated signaling promotes the activation of a variety of downstream pathways, including PKC, MAPK, and PI3K signaling, which promote several cellular processes such as endothelial permeability (PMID: 15545522, 25839425, 30559191). Overexpression of CYSLTR2 has been reported in several cancer types including colon cancer (PMID: 28402256, 21203429, 23829413). Recurrent somatic mutations in CYSLTR2 are found in patients with uveal melanoma and other related tumor types (PMID: 27089179, 31671564, 29476293, 27934878). These alterations promote ligand-independent activation of CYSLTR2, resulting in pigmentation defects and melanocytic phenotypes (PMID: 27089179).	false

DAXX (death domain-associated protein) is a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and apoptosis (PMID: 16406523, 9215629). DAXX accumulates in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm; in the nucleus, DAXX associates with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body and with ATRX-positive heterochromatic regions. In the cytoplasm, DAXX has been reported to interact with various proteins involved in cell death regulation. The proteins encoded by ATRX and DAXX interact with one another and play multiple cellular roles, including chromatin remodeling at telomeres, where they are required for the incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 (PMID:12953102, 21047901, 20651253, 21029860).

DAZAP1 is an RNA binding protein that is a member of the Musashi protein family (PMID: 19285026, 21576381). DAZAP1 is highly expressed in the testes and functions as an important regulator of spermatogenesis and development (PMID: 15700540, 18669443, 16772659, 28575377). Several cellular processes related to mRNA stability and protein translation are regulated by DAZAP1 (PMID: 19285026, 21576381). Localization of DAZAP1 is controlled by active transcription and MAPK-directed phosphorylation, and DAZAP1 has been shown to have nuclear shuttling and mRNA transport activities (PMID: 16772659, 15700540, 16848763). DAZAP1 interacts with the mRNA processing enzymes hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 to control splicing (PMID: 29505834, 18391021, 18391021, 21858080, 24452013). In addition, the association of DAZAP1 with DAZ, a gene on the Y chromosome and expressed in germ cells, has been implicated in the regulation of translation (PMID: 16848763). Recurrent translocations with DAZAP1 and the partner protein MEF2D are found in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (PMID: 28778863, 30630978) and are associated with poor patient outcome (PMID: 27507882, 27824051). MEF2D-DAZAP1 fusion proteins demonstrate oncogenic activity by increasing MEF2D transcriptional activity, HDAC9 expression, and cellular transformation (PMID: 15182431, 27507882, 27824051). HDAC inhibition may be efficacious in patients with MEF2D translocations (PMID: 27507882).	false

DCUN1D1 (also SCCRO and DCN1) is a component of E3 ligase complexes that mediate neddylation (PMID: 18826954, 31898237). Neddylation is a cellular process that places a ubiquitin-like modification (NEDD8) on E3 ligase-associated substrate proteins via cullin protein scaffolding  (PMID: 18826954). DCUN1D1 binds to cullin-RING E3 ligase complexes in the cytoplasm and coordinates nuclear translocation, promoting the optimal transfer of NEDD8 from the E2 complex to cullin-associated substrates (PMID: 28581483, 31898237). DCUN1D1 activity is implicated in the regulation of a variety of proteins, including the activation of the VHL E3 ligase and other cullin ubiquitin ligases (PMID: 26743088, 23201271, 23401859). In addition, DCUN1D1 can relieve the negative inhibition of CAND1, a protein that binds unneddylated cullin-RING complexes (PMID: 25349211). Overexpression of DCUN1D1 is found in cancer, including in non-small cell lung cancer, and may be associated with a poorer prognosis (PMID:22500162, 27285984, 25411243). Amplification of DCUN1D1 is observed in squamous cell carcinomas and is associated with cancer progression (PMID:17018598, 23908357). Inhibitors of enzymes in the neddylation pathway are currently in clinical development (PMID: 26675347, 26423795, 28581483).	false

DDIT3 (CHOP) is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors and is involved in negative regulation of adipocyte differentiation (PMID: 7805034). In normal cells, DDIT3 expression and activity is induced by cellular ER stress, specifically DNA damage and irradiation exposure. Overexpression of DDIT3 from ER stress can ultimately lead to activation of apoptotic pathways (PMID: 11121490, 1617653, 8754828, 14685163) due to a decrease in Bcl-2 expression and subsequent translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria (PMID: 14685163). Translocations of DDIT3 such as the EWSR1-DDIT3 fusion and the FUS-DDIT3 fusion are found in liposarcomas, which abolish the ability of DDIT3 to arrest cell growth leading to aberrant cellular proliferation (PMID:24790523, 24320889).	false	
ENST00000367921	NM_006182.2	ENST00000367921	NM_006182.2	4921	DDR2	true			DDR2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is mutated at low frequencies in various cancers.	DDR2 (Discoidin Domain Receptor 2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates several downstream signaling pathways. When the extracellular discoidin domain of the receptor is bound by its cognate ligand, collagen, autophosphorylation of the DDR2 intracellular kinase domain is initiated, which results in activation of several downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Activation of these pathways promotes cellular migration, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 16186108, 17703188, 16626936). DDR2 activation or expression has been implicated in metastasis of various cancer types, such as colorectal cancer, melanoma and breast cancer (PMID: 22071959, 21735168, 21701781, 23644467, 25130389) through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. Somatic gain-of-function mutations in DDR2 have been identified in squamous cell lung cancers (PMID: 22768234, 22328973) and at lower frequencies in other cancers. Clinical responses to targeted therapy with dasatinib have been reported in patients with squamous cell lung cancer with DDR2 mutations (PMID: 22328973).	false

DDX3X (also DDX) is an RNA helicase that is a member of the DEAD box protein family. DDX3X is implicated in a variety of cellular functions that regulate RNA structure including RNA transport, translation initiation, splicing, ribosome, and spliceosome assembly (PMID: 17667941, 27180681). In addition, DDX3X mediates cell cycle control by regulating translational initiation of key cell cycle proteins, including Cyclin E1 (PMID: 20837705) and hypoxia-inducible genes, including HIF-1Î± (PMID: 21448281). Germline mutations in DDX3X are found in patients with intellectual disabilities (PMID: 28135719, 26235985). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in DDX3X are found in patients with medulloblastoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mesothelioma and head and neck cancers (PMID: 22150006, 22722829, 22820256, 21798893, 26928227, 26192917), suggesting that DDX3X predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor. DDX3X is commonly mutated in tumor types with altered WNT signaling and has been implicated as a transcriptional regulator of WNT responsive genes (PMID: 22820256). Expression of DDX3X has been linked to a cancer stem cell population and may mediate resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (PMID: 25343452). Small molecule inhibitors targeting DDX3X are under preclinical investigation (PMID: 25820276).	true

DDX4 (also VASA) is an RNA helicase that is a member of the DEAD box protein family (PMID: 28612512). Expression of DDX4 is localized predominantly in migratory primordial germ cells, and DDX4 is important for embryonic patterning and germline specification (PMID: 10920202, 11178242, 11178242). More specifically, DDX4 may be a marker of oocyte precursor cells (PMID: 26444630, 22366948, 29725036); however, this result is controversial (PMID: 32123174). DDX4 interacts with the general translation factor eIF5B and mediates translation of many mRNAs involved in germline specification and maintenance (PMID: 10920202, 16630817, 28612512). The eIF5B-DDX4 interaction facilitates ATP hydrolysis and specific RNA unwinding functions, which may be suitable for RNAs with specific structures (PMID: 16630817). Transient DDX4 expression has also been found in the context of regeneration in somatic cells or during wound healing (PMID: 27179696). The activity of DDX4 is also implicated in the transport of PIWI RNAs to the cytoplasm in germ cells, which is important for the suppression of transposable elements (PMID: 28612512, 23587717). DDX4 expression has been found in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues (PMID: 27179696, 29963162, 29078734, 28245464). Overexpression of DDX4 in cell lines results in aberrant cell cycle progression, resulting in increased cellular proliferation (PMID: 28612512, 29963162). These abnormal proliferative cellular functions have been associated with dysregulation of PIWI, CCNB1 and E2F1 during cell cycle progression in loss-of-function studies (PMID: 28612512). In addition, DDX4 has been found to bind mitotic spindles in cancer cells and has a role in mediating cellular migration (PMID: 28612512).	false

Germline mutations of DDX41 predispose to myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.	DDX41 is an RNA helicase that is a member of the DEAD-box protein family (PMID: 27502187). RNA helicases have diverse cellular functions including roles in RNA metabolism, immune response and viral infection (PMID: 27502187). In dendritic cells, DDX41 functions as a DNA sensor that recognizes double-stranded DNA or cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), which are byproducts released during viral or bacterial infection (PMID: 27502187, 21892174). DDX41 activity regulates the STING pathway, which is important in innate immunity (PMID: 27502187, 28602976, 27721487, 25704810, 23142775). The STING pathway activates type I interferon responses mediated by TBK, IRF1, and NFKB, which are critical for mounting an appropriate response to DNA viruses (PMID: 27502187, 27721487, 25609843). In addition to the role of DDX41 in innate immunity, DDX41 associates with spliceosome proteins and has been implicated in mRNA processing and splicing (PMID: 25920683). Germline, hypomorphic mutations in DDX41 are found in families with a predisposition for hematopoietic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 26712909, 25920683, 31713024, 31484648). DDX41 mutations found in familial carriers predispose individuals to acquire a secondary somatic mutation on the other DDX41 allele, suggesting that DDX41 likely functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 26712909). In addition, individuals with a 5q deletion, a recurrent genetic event in myeloid malignancies, exhibit haploinsufficient expression of DDX41 (PMID: 25920683). DDX41 alterations commonly occur in the ATP binding domain, consistent with the importance of ATP binding in DNA sensing (PMID: 27721487). Lenalidomide sensitivity has been reported in patients with DDX41-mutant myeloid malignancies (PMID: 31400013, 25920683).	true

DDX5, a member of the DEAD-box family, encodes for an RNA helicase that functions in the regulation of cellular processes through remodeling RNA secondary structures during transcription and pre-mRNA maturation (PMID: 32376686). DDX5 interacts with various different genes, including TP53 and CTCF, to mediate transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage (PMID: 22986526, 20966046). DDX5 activates signaling pathways, including the WNT, AKT and mTOR pathways, to regulate cell proliferation, cell cycle control and glucose metabolism (PMID: 28411202). Overexpression of DDX5 in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis, suggesting that DDX5 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 28216662, 26212035, 22750847). DDX5 amplification has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 22750847, 26212035).

DEK is a nuclear protein with roles in DNA binding and chromatin regulation (PMID: 25524609). DEK is ubiquitously expressed and modifies chromatin by altering the superhelical density of DNA, introducing positive supercoils to alter DNA structure (PMID: 11997399, 10837023). DEK also interacts with the chromatin-modifying enzyme p300 and PCAF in order to maintain heterochromatin state and influence gene expression (PMID: 16696975, 21460035). In addition to regulating epigenetic state, DEK facilitates cellular proliferation by resolving conditions of DNA replication stress at the replication fork (PMID: 25347734). DEK forms a complex with the DNA repair protein RAD51 and is a critical mediator of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (PMID: 28317934). Loss of DEK expression results in genome instability and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (PMID: 28317934). DEK is also required for other cellular functions including mRNA splicing, apoptosis, and chemoresistance, among others (PMID: 19679545, 28317934). DEK is overexpressed in several tumor types including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, small cell lung cancer, among others, and increased DEK expression is linked to poor patient prognosis (PMID: 25197373, 23902796, 21663673, 25544761, 24608431). Recurrent DEK rearrangements are found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia which result in increased DEK expression, suggesting that DEK functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 25524609).	false

Germline mutations in DICER1 predispose to various cancer types, including pleuropulmonary blastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, cystic nephroma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor and endocrine tumors.	DICER1 is an endoribonuclease that catalyzes the cleavage of large RNA molecules into silencing RNAs or microRNAs. In addition, DICER1 loads siRNA onto the Argonaute protein and mediates the binding of co-factors to initiate RNA-induced silencing (PMID: 25176334). In this way, DICER1 plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (PMID: 25176334). Germline mutations in DICER1 are associated with DICER1-related disorders, a familial tumor susceptibility syndrome that confers increased risk most commonly for pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), cystic nephroma (CN), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), multinodular goiter, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor and other neoplastic conditions (PMID: 19556464, 21266384, 21882293, 24761742). The majority of germline mutations in DICER1 are nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations leading to premature protein truncation and loss of protein function (PMID: 21266384, 19556464, 25176334). Somatic DICER1 mutations have also been identified, predominantly affecting the region of the protein that mediates the interaction of DICER1 with miRNAs (PMID: 25176334). DICER1 has been identified as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 19903759, 20019750), as monoallelic but biallelic loss of DICER1 causes tumor formation. Consistent with the role of DICER1 as a tumor suppressor, reduced expression of DICER1 correlates with a poor outcome in lung, breast, skin, endometrial and ovarian cancer (PMID: 15723655, 19092150, 19782670, 20210522, 20832293).	true

DIS3 (also Rrp44) is an exoribonuclease that is a member of the RNase II/RNB protein family (PMID: 31342438). DIS3 is the catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome complex, which coordinates 3â to 5â degradation of RNA (PMID: 20531389, 21289487). The exosome complex prominently participates in RNA processing and quality control pathways (PMID: 21289487). In addition, DIS3 regulates the maturation of many RNA targets, including the tumor suppressor let-7 miRNAs, which control the translation of oncogenes such as MYC and RAS (PMID: 25925570, 26305418). Recurrent familial and somatic mutations of DIS3 have been found in patients with multiple myeloma (PMID: 21430775, 24434212, 22573403, 25521164, 23396385, 22237025, 30967618). These DIS3 loss-of-function mutations have been shown to interfere with the exonucleolytic activity, causing defects in RNA processing, cellular proliferation, and protein translation (PMID: 24150935). In contrast, DIS3 amplification and overexpression have been detected in several cancer types, including colon cancer and melanoma, suggesting that the consequence of DIS3 alteration may be context-specific (PMID: 23319804, 24478024, 21343389).	true

DKK1 is an extracellular ligand that is a member of the Dickkopf protein family (PMID: 28979801, 17143291). DKK1 functions as a negative regulator of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to LRP5/6 co-receptors and precluding WNT-mediated activation of downstream signaling (PMID: 28979801, 17143291, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID:  28218291). DKK1-mediated antagonism of WNT blocks Frizzled receptor binding to LRP5/6 and results in the activation of the Î²-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3Î² and AXIN), which targets Î²-catenin for degradation (PMID: 23258168). In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of Î²-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). DKK1 also binds to the receptors Kremen1 and Kremen2 to remove the LRP6 co-receptor from the plasma membrane (PMID: 12050670). In addition, DKK1 is involved in the regulation of many cellular functions including developmental patterning, apoptosis, angiogenesis and invasion (PMID: 22807036, 27608843, 28979801, 11702953, 31568519).

In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of Î²-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). In addition, DKK3 is involved in the regulation of many cellular functions including developmental patterning, apoptosis, immune response, and invasion (PMID: 21268126, 25573172, 28738084, 26278164). Somatic mutations in DKK3 in human cancers are relatively uncommon; however, DKK3 is found to be downregulated or overexpressed in distinct cancer subtypes (PMID: 27801786, 27467270, 27788486, 26093488).	false

DKK4 is an extracellular ligand that is a member of the Dickkopf protein family (PMID: 28979801, 17143291). DKK4 functions as a negative regulator of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to LRP5/6 co-receptors and precluding WNT-mediated activation of downstream signaling (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID:  28218291). DKK4-mediated antagonism of WNT blocks Frizzled receptor binding to LRP5/6 and results in the activation of the Î²-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3Î² and AXIN), which targets Î²-catenin for degradation (PMID: 23258168). In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of Î²-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). DKK4 also binds to the receptors Kremen1 and Kremen2 to remove the LRP6 co-receptor from the plasma membrane (PMID: 12527209). In addition, DKK4 is involved in the regulation of many cellular functions including developmental patterning, apoptosis, angiogenesis and invasion (PMID: 27272409, 23958302). Somatic mutations in DKK4 in human cancers are relatively uncommon; however, DKK4 is found to be downregulated or overexpressed in distinct cancer subtypes (PMID: 22216841, 17675336, 29904276, 21994129, 26880586, 19059704) suggesting it may have roles as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the specific cellular context.	false

DNAJB1 (DNAJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1) is a member of the HSP40 protein family and has been linked to several cellular processes, such as the proteasome pathway, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and virus infection (PMID:19340594, 22075554, 23400395, 21698289). DNAJB1 interacts with HSP70 and induces its ATPase activity, which stimulates the association between HSP70 and Hsc70-interacting protein (HIP) (PMID: 24309468). A seminal feature of DNAJB1 is the presence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) tumors. Numerous independent studies have confirmed the presence of the fusion gene in 80-100% of FLCs tumor samples (PMID: 25557953, 25698061, 25605237, 25122662, 24578576, 26489647). The fusion encodes a chimeric protein that couples a segment of DNAJB1, with the catalytic domain of protein kinase A (PKA) that confers constitutive kinase activity. Although analyses of a wider array of cancer types are required to more definitively establish the specificity of DNAJB1-PRKACA to FLCs, the current evidence suggests that DNAJB1-PRKACA may be a tissue biomarker for FLCs and if the chimeric protein is secreted into circulation, it may also serve as a plasma biomarker.	false

DNM2, a member of the dynamin superfamily, encodes for a GTPase that functions in clathrin-independent and -dependent endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking (PMID: 20858595). DNM2 regulates the T-cell receptor-mediated signaling pathways and T-cell activation through interaction with VAV1 (PMID: 15696170). Overexpression of DNM2 in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that DNM2 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 27885263, 21841817). DNM2 amplification has been identified in various types of cancer, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate cancer and breast cancer (PMID: 27885263, 24402972, 33250680). DNM2 expression is a potential therapeutic target with preclinical studies investigating the efficacy of anti-DNM2 inhibitors in various types of cancer (PMID: 20571068, 21750222).	false

DNMT1 is a DNA methyltransferase that mediates the transfer of methyl groups to CpG sites in DNA (PMID: 21163962, 29033456). DNA methylation at gene promoters predominantly results in gene repression by precluding the binding of important transcriptional machinery (PMID: 23400093). DNMT1 preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA, namely daughter strands that are newly generated during the cell cycle (PMID: 21163962). DNMT1 plays an important role in a number of physiologic processes such as X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, chromosomal stability, and repression of retrotransposon expression. DNMT1 mutations are rarely found in human cancers; however, DNMT1 overexpression has been observed in colon cancer (PMID: 2014266, PMID: 10463569), gastric cancer (PMID: 14742272), breast cancer (PMID: 14555514), bladder cancer (PMID: 14634451), and acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia (PMID: 11222358). Increased activity of DNMT1 can lead to altered DNA methylation and abnormal transcriptional silencing (PMID: 29033456). The DNMT1 inhibitor azacytidine is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with specific myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (PMID: 15897554) and may have efficacy in patients with mutations in other epigenetic modifiers that impact DNA methylation state (PMID: 28193779).	false

DNMT3A is a DNA methyltransferase that is responsible for establishing de novo genomic DNA methylation at CpG sites. DNA methylation at gene promoters predominantly results in gene repression by precluding the binding of important transcriptional machinery (PMID: 23400093). DNMT3A functions in concert with another de novo methyltransferase, DNMT3B, and a maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1, assisted by non-catalytic subunit DNMT3L (PMID: 21243710). CpG methylation is important for maintaining epigenetic tissue-specific gene expression patterns, genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, silencing of parasitic DNA sequences and genome integrity (PMID: 12359337, 15215868). Germline mutations in DNMT3A result in Tatton-Brown-Rahman overgrowth syndrome, a disorder associated with intellectual disability (PMID: 24614070), and overexpression has been linked to melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 24589714). DNMT3A is recurrently mutated in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (up to 30% of all cases) (PMID: 21067377, 21399634, 22417203, 23634996), and at lower frequencies in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 21993668), myeloproliferative neoplasms (PMID: 21537334), myelodysplastic syndromes (PMID: 21415852, 21519343) and in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (PMID: 23341344, 23603912, 23687089).

Germline biallelic mutations in DNMT3B are associated with ICF (immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial abnormalities) syndrome (PMID: 10647011, 16501171). Rare mutations in the DNMT3B gene have been identified and dysregulated expression of DNMTs and/or aberrant DNA methylation patterns are found in various cancer types (PMID: 21941284, 22037554, 22895193).

DOT1L is a histone H3K79 methyltransferase, methylating the histone 3 lysine 79 residue (PMID:12123582). H3K79 methylation is associated with DNA damage response to double strand breaks (PMID:15525939). This modification has also been implicated in diverse cellular and developmental processes including cell division, embryonic development, meiosis, and hematopoiesis (PMID:21724828, 24526115). H3K79 methylation modifies chromatin structure and can promote active transcription (PMID:18285465). In leukemias, this modification promotes active transcription by preventing the binding of the inhibitory Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) complex (PMID:25822366). In mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) translocation leukemias, DOT1L was shown to be important for the transformation activity of the MLL fusion protein, and inhibitors of DOT1L have been employed in the treatment of this subset of leukemias (PMID:18977325, 15851025, 21741596). In breast cancer, DOT1L has been shown to cooperate with a c-Myc-p300 complex to promote epithelial to mesechymal transition and clinically is associated with more aggressive disease (PMID:26199140). Mutations in DOT1L have been identified in large-scale sequencing efforts of solid tumors including colon, small cell lung cancer, and squamous head and neck cancer (PMID:22810696, 26168399, 25056374).	false

DPYD encodes for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which is the rate-limiting factor in uracil and thymidine catabolism (PMID: 36172669). Deletions in the gene result in loss of the enzymeâs activity, which has been associated with delayed motor skill development, seizures, and intellectual disability linked to congenital thymine-uraciluria (PMID: 36661700, 35607723). Loss of the gene also increases the risk of toxicity in cancer patients receiving 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy (PMID: 35607723, 36172669, 36757428,36661700). 5-fluorouracil and its oral prodrugs capecitabine and tegafur are used in the treatment of several cancers including colon, stomach, and breast (PMID: 36757428, 36661700, 36172669).

DROSHA is an RNA-specific endoribonuclease III involved in the initial steps of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. DROSHA, forming a complex with DGCR8, cleaves the double-stranded stem-loop structured pri-miRNA into pre-miRNA, which is subsequently exported to the cytosol where it can be further processed, ultimately leading to specific mRNA silencing (PMID: 14508493, 19239886, 23654304). DROSHA has been reported to be both up- and downregulated in several cancers, suggesting tissue-specific mechanisms in tumorigenesis (PMID: 20832293, 21559780, 20210522). Somatic mutations in DROSHA are found in a small proportion of cancers including in pediatric Wilmâs tumors (PMID: 25670083, 25190313) and DROSHA amplifications have been identified in lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 26156018).

DTX1 (also Deltex-1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that also functions as a transcriptional regulator (PMID: 12670957). DTX1 ubiquitinates substrates, including MEKK1 and C-FLIP, and targets them to the proteasome for degradation (PMID: 15684388, 29374180). High expression of DTX1 is found in germinal center B cells, marginal zone B cells, lymphoid cells and the nervous system (PMID: 22891273, 15684394, 26714454). The activity of DTX1 is important for regulation of T cell anergy and FOXP3 activity in regulatory T cells (PMID: 25695215, 19592273). In addition, DTX1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of Notch in association with the coactivator p300 to inhibit neural progenitor (PMID: 11564735, 14567914), B, NK, and T cell differentiation (PMID: 15187027, 27048872). The mechanism by which DTX1 regulates NOTCH signaling is not fully delineated; however, DTX1 may inhibit NOTCH by targeting the receptor for endosomal recycling (PMID: 29440432) and DTX1 itself is a target of NOTCH transcriptional regulation (PMID: 9056690). Somatic DTX1 mutations are found in patients with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (PMID: 22891273) and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (PMID: 25171927). These DTX1 alterations are predicted to disrupt Notch signaling and contribute to abnormal hematopoietic differentiation (PMID: 22891273, 25171927).

DUSP22 (also JKAP, JSP-1) is a dual-specificity phosphatase with several roles in the regulation of downstream signaling pathways. Dual-specificity phosphatases can dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues within the same substrate (PMID: 19228121). DUSP22 inhibits T-cell receptor signaling by dephosphorylating and inactivating MAPK and ERK2 (PMID: 11733513) In addition, DUSP22 is a negative regulator of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and is an inhibitor of cell migration via reduced FAK activity (PMID: 20018849). DUSP22 can also positively regulate downstream signaling pathways; for example, DUSP22 binds JNK and activates the JNK pathway (PMID: 11717427, 27711255). Because DUSP22 has been implicated in the regulation of several signaling pathways, DUSP22 is thought to be involved in mediating various cellular functions including cell proliferation, cell death, chemotaxis and T-cell receptor signaling (PMID: 24714587, 28725226, 27711255, 28017968). Fusion proteins including DUSP22 are found in anaplastic large cell lymphomas negative for ALK-rearrangements (PMID: 21030553, 24805854, 26104084). These alterations are predicted to disrupt DUSP22 activity, suggesting that DUSP22 functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 27626696).	true

DUSP4 is a protein tyrosine/threonine phosphatase that regulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathway. DUSP4 negatively regulates the MAPK/ERK pathway by dephosphorylating ERK1/2 (PMID: 7535768). In addition, DUSP4 dephosphorylates substrates in the JNK pathway and mediates crosstalk between the JNK/JUN and MAPK/ERK pathways (PMID: 29795445). DUSP4 itself is a transcriptional target of MAPK-activated ERK1/2, and in turn inhibits ERK1/2 through a negative feedback mechanism, thus tempering MAPK-induced cell growth and proliferation (PMID: 22430215). DUSP4 expression has been found to be up- or downregulated in several cancer types; however, somatic mutations in DUSP4 are rare and have not yet been functionally characterized (PMID: 22965873, 22430215). DUSP4 loss has been associated with resistance to MEK inhibition, resulting in activation of associated signaling pathways (PMID: 29795445).	true

E2F3 (E2F transcription factor 3) is a member of the E2F family of transcription factors. E2F3 is related to E2F1 and E2F2 with which it shares similar DNA-binding, RB protein-binding, dimerization, and transcriptional activation domains (PMID: 8246996). E2F1-3 also bind induce transcription from to the same E2F recognition motifs in vitro and associate with RB. (PMID: 8246996). Additionally, E2F1-3 are considered inducers of gene expression and their transcription and proteasomal degradation are controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner as opposed to the constitutively expressed transcriptional repressors E2F4-6 (PMID: 12748276). E2F proteins play overlapping roles in various processes, including DNA replication, progression through from G1 to S stages of the cell cycle, and cell-fate determination but they also appear to have certain distinct functions (PMID: 12748276, 9679057). The RB/E2F axis is considered a pivotal in activating DNA replication and G1/S transition in a manner dependent on RB's inhibitory effect on E2F proteins (PMID: 8246996, 11257102, 9365528). E2F3-specific activity includes TFE3 binding and DDX5 induction, mediation of MYC-induced transition to S phase (together with E2F2), and induction of specific target genes (PMID: 12748276, 10733529, 11511364) E2F3-deficient mice exhibit impaired growth and cell proliferation (PMID: 10733529). Amplification and subsequent overexpression of E2F3 has been observed in prostate and bladder cancer as well as lung cancer and metastatic urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 14716298, 15122326, 18037967, 16953223, 16938365, 15184867, 16909110, 24476821, 25886454).

EBF1 encodes for a transcription factor that regulates various processes associated with B-cell lymphopoiesis, transcription and activation (PMID: 20451411). EBF1 and PAX5 work synergistically to regulate B-cell expansion and lineage commitment via a MYC-dependent regulatory loop and other feedback loops (PMID: 33619557, 17101802). The oncogenic function of EBF1 may be tissue-specific. Knockdown of EBF1 in various cancer cell lines induces increased TERT promoter activity, cellular viability and cellular proliferation, suggesting that EBF1 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 32364535, 28555080). Downregulation of EBF1 has been identified in various cancer types, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma (PMID: 17344859, 32676457, 29169115, 32364535). Conversely, overexpression of EBF1 in acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer cell lines induces cellular proliferation, cellular migration, the inhibition of apoptosis and cell cycle progression, suggesting that EBF1 functions predominantly as an oncogene in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 35867755)(Abstract: Zhou et al.

ECSIT is an adaptor protein that functions in the assembly of the mitochondrial complex I (PMID: 17344420). Mitochondrial complex I is the largest subunit of the respiratory chain, functioning in the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone as a proton pump for ATP synthesis (PMID: 13771349). ECSIT is directed by an N-terminal targeting sequence to localize to the mitochondria, allowing for interaction with chaperone protein NDUFAF1 and subsequent assembly and stabilization of mitochondrial complex I (PMID: 17344420). Other functions for ECSIT include activation of the inflammatory response through the Toll signaling pathway and embryonic development through the BMP signaling pathway (PMID: 10465784, 14633973). Overexpression of ECSIT in breast cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models increases cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that ECSIT functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 35571656).

GTPases regulate downstream signaling pathways and are involved in a variety of cellular functions including proliferation, cell adhesion, and cell cycle progression, among others (PMID: 27301673). Additional functional work is required to determine the exact cellular function of ECT2L. Somatic mutations in ECT2L are found in patients with T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 22237106).

EED (Embryonic Ectoderm Development) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) which is responsible for transcriptional repression by catalyzing di- and tri-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) (PMID: 16630818). The EED-EZH2 interaction is necessary for the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 (PMID: 23974116), which is important in regulating development and expression of cell identity genes, including the HOX cluster of genes (PMID: 16625203). EED interacts with the PRC1 complex to mediate histone H2A ubiquitination (PMID: 24457600), and germline mutations have been identified with an over-growth syndrome (PMID: 25787343). EED is mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 25240281, 22237106, 23486531).

Its role in cancer is unclear, but its ability to modulate angiogenesis and immune responses has been proposed to influence tumorigenesis (PMID: 22037871). Elevated expression of EGFL7 has been found in human tumors, including glioma, hepatocellular carcinomas, breast cancer and suggesting a potential role as a biomarker (PMID: 19503073, 19824075, 26328008, 23558933, 23404186).	false

EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by EGF family extracellular ligands (PMID: 24691965). EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptors, including the receptors ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4. Binding of EGFR by its ligands, including EGF ligands and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFÎ±), activates downstream signaling pathways including the canonical MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades (PMID: 22239438). EGFR can homodimerize or heterodimerize with other ErbB family members to initiate signaling (PMID: 25621509). Activation of EGFR-mediated signaling ultimately results in cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (PMID: 18045542). While EGFR usually is expressed at low levels in normal adult tissues, hyperactivation of this receptor by somatic mutations and/or amplification of the EGFR gene is found in many cancer types such as lung, brain, colorectal and head and neck cancer (PMID: 10880430, 17318210). In lung cancer, activating mutations in EGFR result in a constitutively activated form of the receptor that is sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition (PMID: 15329413). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR, including afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib, have been approved for first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients (PMID: 14977817, 24868098, 26039556, 25963089). Second site resistance mutations in EGFR can occur in cancers previously treated with these inhibitors (PMID: 29068003). Osimertinib is a second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been FDA approved for relapsed patients with non-small cell lung cancer with the EGFR resistance mutations T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletions (PMID: 27923840). Additionally, copy number amplification of the EGFR gene result in receptor overexpression in several cancer types, including brain and colorectal cancers, and these cancers may also be sensitive to EGFR inhibition (PMID: 11426640).	false	R2

EGR1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the EGR family of zinc finger proteins (PMID: 16138117). EGR1 stimulates the transcriptional activity of several key tumor suppressor genes including TGFÎ²1, PTEN, TP53, and fibronectin (PMID: 16138117). The activity of EGR1 is required to mediate several cellular functions induced by these tumor suppressors including growth control, differentiation, cell attachment and apoptosis (PMID: 16138117). EGR1 is also implicated in immune regulation; EGR1 expression is upregulated after T cell stimulation and mediates B cell development (PMID: 19915002, 18802061). In addition, EGR1 regulates the activity of CBP/p300 transcription coactivators in prostate cells (PMID: 15225550). Loss of EGR1 in preclinical models results in transformation, hematopoietic defects and increased tumor formation in murine models (PMID: 17420284). EGR1 expression has been found to be reduced in a variety of tumor types, suggesting that EGR1 functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 9212230). Somatic mutations in EGR1 are found in follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphomas (PMID: 24362818, 22158541, 22891273, 24145436). EGR1 alterations typically occur in the N-terminus and are predicted to be loss-of-function (PMID: 24362818). Conversely, EGR1 expression is overexpressed in prostate cancer and may function as an oncogene in that context (PMID: 12833142, 16138117).	true	
ENST00000379607	NM_001412.3	ENST00000379607	NM_001412.3	1964	EIF1AX	false			EIF1AX, a translation initiation factor, is most frequently altered by mutation in uveal melanomas and papillary thyroid carcinomas.	EIF1AX (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, X-linked) is a eukaryotic translation initiation factor. EIF1AX triggers the transfer of the methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi)-eIF2-GTP ternary complex to the 40S ribosomal subunit (PMID: 16193068). This complex creates the 43S pre-initiation complex which binds to the capped 5'-end of mRNA and subsequently reads the mRNA until it finds the first AUG codon (PMID: 23873042). Mutations in EIF1AX have been observed in uveal melanomas with disomy 3 and are associated with an increased risk of metastasis (PMID: 23793026, 24970262). EIF1AX mutations have also been identified in some cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma and leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms (PMID: 25417114, 26769193). Alterations of the EIF1AX gene are predominantly missense mutations that alter the protein's highly conserved N-terminus, which is critical for the initiation of protein translation (PMID: 23793026, 16193068, 24970262).	false	
ENST00000424014	NM_001414	ENST00000424014	NM_001414	1967	EIF2B1	false			EIF2B1, a subunit of the EIF2B guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex, is infrequently mutated in cancer.	EIF2B1 is a subunit of EIF2B, a five-subunit guanine nucleotide exchange factor that plays a key role in mRNA translation regulation (PMID: 29425030, 18974117). The EIF2B five subunit complex is composed of EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4 and EIF2B5, which encode for the Î±, Î², Î³, Î´ and Îµ subunits, respectively (PMID: 29425030). EIF2B functions as the nucleotide exchange factor for the GTPase EIF2, which initiates translation by bringing methionyl-tRNA to the ribosome (PMID: 29425030). EIF2B complex activity is inhibited when EIF2 is phosphorylated by stress-induced kinases (PMID: 29425030). EIF2B1, along with subunits EIF2B2 and EIF2B4, forms the regulatory subcomplex of EIF2B (PMID: 24811713). EIF2B2 and EIF2B4 have been identified as essential to the translation initiation and nucleotide exchange activity with EIF2, whereas EIF2B1 is required for inhibiting translation (PMID: 29036434). EIF2B1 mutations disrupt the ability of EIF2B to sense phosphorylated EIF2, resulting in increased endoplasmic reticulum stress (PMID: 31882561). The stress conditions have been identified as a cause for patient liver dysfunction and leukoencephalopathy due to unregulated unfolded protein response and cell death (PMID: 31882561, 25761052).	true

EIF3E encodes for a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (EIF3) complex, which functions in the initiation of protein synthesis (PMID: 17581632). EIF3E regulates various cellular processes including cellular proliferation, DNA damage response repair and protein degradation through the regulation of translation and binding to other multiprotein complexes (PMID: 25849773, 22508697, 17324924). The oncogenic function of EIF3E may be tissue-specific. Overexpression of EIF3E in various cancer cell lines induces cellular proliferation, cellular invasion and tumor growth, suggesting that EIF3E functions predominantly as an oncogene in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 20453879, 25400724). EIF3E amplification has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, colon cancer and oral cancer (PMID: 20453879, 24481065, 25400724, 25123227). Conversely, loss of EIF3E in other cancer cell line studies has shown induction of cellular senescence, increased mTORC1 signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, suggesting that EIF3E also has tumor suppressive functions in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 33868586, 22907435). EIF3E downregulation has been identified in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 22907435, 15867213). Preclinical studies of breast cancer cells suggest that loss of EIF3E confers resistance to PARP inhibition (PMID: 33868586).	false

EIF4A2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A2) is a translation initiation factor required for binding of mRNA ribosomal subunits. EIF4A2 is one of three mammalian isoforms of EIF4A (EIF4A1-3) which are mRNA-dependent ATPases and RNA helicases and members of the DEAD-box family of proteins, a group of proteins named after their shared motifs with roles in various cellular processes (PMID: 10872469, 2563148). More specifically, EIF4A2 is an essential factor in the binding of mRNA to the 43S pre-initiation complex, a rate-limiting step and main target of translational control, in which EIF4A2 unwinds mRNA secondary structure to enable the ribosome to bind to a single-stranded molecule (PMID: 10872469). EIF4A2 and EIF4A1 are highly similar in sequence and function but appear to be expressed in spatiotemporally distinct patterns (PMID: 3046931, 8521730). EIF4A2 has also been implicated in micro-RNA-mediated gene regulation (PMID: 23559250). Downregulation of EIF4A2 expression has been observed in non-small cell lung cancer and correlates with poor prognosis, but mutations in EIF4A2 are rare in human tumors (PMID: 23867391).	false

EIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ) is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex. The eIF4F complex additionally consists of an EIF4A isoform and EIF4G and directs the ribosome to the 5' 7-methylguanosine cap of mRNAs in what is considered a rate-limiting step of translation (PMID: 291969, 3469651). As a vital part of translation initiation, EIF4E controls cellular size and is thought to be a direct target of mTOR, which can phosphorylate the translational repressor 4EBP1, allowing for EIF4E to enter the eIF4F complex (PMID: 12080086). Overexpression of EIF4E has been detected in tumors of the breast, bladder, colon, lung, and cervix and can cause malignant transformation in in vitro studies (PMID: 9330633, 9285563, 8244582, 7829225, 25986608, 10638984, 11401917, 12374671, 16260273, 16280668, 20049173). Furthermore, EIF4E exhibits oncogenic traits in a mouse model of lymphoma and is implicated in drug resistance both in contexts of mTOR, BRAF, and MEK targeting (PMID: 15029198, 16103051, 25079330, 25422161, 25615552). Thus, EIF4E is considered a therapeutic target in certain tumor types on the principles that translational control often is deregulated in cancer cells and that PI3K and mTOR signaling and MAPK-interacting kinases (MNKs) are involved in this process (PMID: 22474009, 25743081, 25425688). A variant in the promoter region of EIF4E has been identified in two families with autistic children (PMID: 19556253).	false

ELF3 is a member of the ETS-family of transcription factors. ELF3 binds ETS-consensus sequences present in many gene promoters, either activating or repressing their transcription in physiological conditions (PMID: 21548782, 10773884). ELF3 both activates NF-ÎºB-mediated inflammatory pathways and represses androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancers, leading to cancer progression and increased cell migration, respectively (PMID: 23687337, 23435425). ELF3 regulates Î²-catenin transcription in colorectal cancer (PMID: 24874735). and plays an important role in the mammary gland (PMID: 10959418). Amplification of ELF3 is a frequent events in breast cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016), and oncogenic inactivating mutations in ELF3 have also been identified in ampullary cancers (PMID: 26806338).	true

ELF4 regulates innate immunity by promoting the development of natural killer cells and CD8+ T-cells and suppressing the inflammatory response of macrophages, Th17 cells and various pro-inflammatory cytokines (PMID: 34326534, 35266071). The oncogenic function of ELF4 is likely tissue-specific. Overexpression of ELF4 in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation, colony formation and tumor growth, suggesting that ELF4 functions predominantly as an oncogene in these contexts (PMID: 17213815, 36923538). ELF4 amplification has been identified in various types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia and esophageal adenocarcinoma (PMID: 33836003). Conversely, overexpression of ELF4 in lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma cell lines suppressed cellular growth and invasiveness, suggesting that ELF4 may have tumor suppressive function in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 12438253, 26921333).	false

ELK4 regulates the KDM5A-PJA2-KSR1 axis through transcriptional activation of KDM5A to promote macrophage M2 polarization (PMID: 34372882). Overexpression of ELK4 in gastric cancer and melanoma cell lines and xenograft models induces increased cellular proliferation, migration and invasion through M2 polarization of macrophages, suggesting that ELK4 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 34372882, 26028036).

ELL encodes for an elongation factor that functions in increasing the catalytic rate of RNA polymerase II through suppression of transient pausing (PMID: 8596958). ELL co-localizes with transcription factor regulators EAF1 and EAF2 within the nucleus to promote elongation activity (PMID: 16006523). Overexpression of ELL in RAT1 fibroblast cells induces anchorage-independent cellular growth and decreased dependence on growth factors, suggesting that ELL functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 9478981). ELL has been identified as a recurrent fusion partner with the gene KMT2A (also known as MLL) in acute myeloid leukemia and other hematological malignancies (PMID: 10995463, 26185637, 26949571, 33608309).	false

ELN encodes for the structural subunit tropoelastin, the soluble precursor of the structural protein elastin that functions as a major component in the elastic fibers that support connective tissues (PMID: 16982180, 21368178). ELN is an extracellular matrix protein and provides dynamic structural support for elasticity in all tissues (PMID: 23273220). Protease-driven elastin degradation can occur during cancer progression at the extracellular matrix and lead to the generation of bioactive fragments and elastin-derived peptides, which further promote tumorigenesis through promoting chemotaxis and cellular proliferation (PMID: 18076073, 20959825, 12244048). Expression of ELN and elastin-derived peptides in various types of cancer cell lines and models induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and increases cellular invasion, migration and proliferation, suggesting that ELN functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 32171282, 30186741, 20959825).

A hotspot mutation of ELOC is associated with a distinct subtype of renal cell carcinoma.	The ELOC (transcription elongation factor B polypeptide 1) gene encodes the elongin C protein, a subunit of the transcription factor B protein complex which activates RNA elongation during transcription (PMID: 7660129). ELOC is also part of the elongin BC complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and includes the Von-Hippel Landau (VHL) tumor suppressor, TCEB2 (elongin B), CUL2 or CUL5 and RBX1 (PMID: 25298778). Under normoxic conditions, this complex targets the hypoxia inducible factor, HIF1A, for ubiquitination and degradation, thus preventing a hypoxic response (PMID: 23797736). However, dysregulation of this complex, including inactivation of VHL or ELOC, can lead to HIF1A accumulation and a pseudohypoxic response, even under normoxic conditions (PMID: 25298778). ELOC-mutated renal carcinomas are molecularly distinct from conventional clear cell renal cell carcinomas, and lack both VHL mutations and chromosome 3p loss (PMID: 25676555, 23797736).	false

EP300 (p300; E1A-binding protein) is a transcriptional co-activator with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity that is homologous to the co-activator CREBBP. EP300 activates transcription by opening chromatin at gene promoters, recruiting transcriptional machinery and acting as a co-factor to recruit transcription factors (PMID: 15186775, 24480624, 11050151, 23474763, 15691758). The HAT activity of EP300 can also regulate the expression of other proteins, including the tumor suppressor p53 and tissue-specific transcription factors like GATA1 (PMID: 9830059, 9859997). Fusion proteins that include the EP300 HAT domain have been identified in rare cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (PMID: 25943178). Somatic mutations in EP300 are found in leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors including small-cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and bladder cancer (PMID: 21390126, 22941188, 24390348, 21822268). EP300 mutations are commonly truncating and often co-occur with loss of the wildtype allele, suggesting that EP300 functions as a tumor suppressor.

EP400 is a chromatin remodeling ATPase that functions as a subunit in the TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex (PMID: 18614019). The TIP60-EP400 chromatin remodeling complex binds at gene promoters and facilitates histone acetylation in order to regulate gene expression and epigenetic state (PMID: 18614019). EP400 is bound at promoters and enhancers enriched with H2AZ and H3.3 histone variants (PMID: 26669263). Loss of EP400 expression results in depletion of H2AZ and H3.3 transcription and deposition on chromatin (PMID: 26669263). EP400 also preferentially binds to H4Kme3-modified histones and regulates the transcription of those genes (PMID: 26814966). Due to the global regulation of gene expression and chromatin state, EP400 activity is required for embryonic stem cell maintenance, regulation of cell cycle, and the DNA damage/repair pathways (PMID: 18614019, 15655109, 27814680). In MYC-altered lymphomas, there is evidence that alternative splicing events occur at EP400 (PMID: 25970242). Somatic mutations in EP400 are infrequent in human cancers; however, alterations have been identified in bladder cancer and childhood lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 26625313, 23508829).	true

EPAS1 (also HIF2Î±) is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in conditions of oxygen deficiency (PMID: 11301389). HIF2Î± binds the hypoxia response element (HRE) present in the promoter of genes that are regulated in the context of reduced oxygen (hypoxia), such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene (PMID: 11301389). Under normal oxygen conditions, HIF2Î± is hydroxylated and recognized by the tumor suppressor VHL, leading to ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (PMID: 18498744). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF2Î± escapes degradation and activates genes involved in the hypoxia response, including genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolysis, apoptosis, proliferation and growth (PMID: 22089927, 14645546). HIF2Î± activity has been implicated in angiogenesis and oncogenesis in neuroendocrine tumor models (PMID: 23533246, 26432405). Gain-of-function EPAS1 mutations are found in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, which are rare neuroendocrine tumors where conditions of pseudo-hypoxia occur (PMID: 22931260, 24741025, 23418310).

It functions as a transmembrane glycoprotein that specifically mediates epithelial specific intercellular cell-adhesion (PMID: 21576002). Germline deletions in the EpCAM gene cause Lynch syndrome via epigenetic silencing of MSH2 (MutS protein homolog 2), leading to a predisposition to colorectal and endometrial cancers (PMID: 19098912). EpCAM is also overexpressed in certain types of solid tumors, though its role in this setting is not fully understood. The bi-specific antibody catumaxomab targets both EpCAM and the T-cell antigen CD3 in an attempt to recruit and activate immune effector cells at the tumor site (PMID: 11588051), and is approved for malignant ascites in patients with EpCAM-positive cancers (PMID: 20473913).	true

In addition to its role in the nervous system, EPHA5 mediates communication between pancreatic islet cells, thereby regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (PMID: 17448994). Downregulation of EPHA5 due to promoter methylation has been observed in both breast and prostate cancer, and it has been suggested that EPHA5 might represent a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of these tumor types (PMID: 19733895, 25609195). Aberrant methylation of the EPHA5 promoter was observed in 91% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in particular in older patients (PMID: 23757320). Increased expression and somatic mutations of EPHA5 have been observed in ovarian cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and lung cancer, among others (PMID: 25623065, 19949912, 19956396, 25634010).	false

EPHA7 (ephrin receptor A7) is a part of the subfamily of the protein-tyrosine kinase family and preferentially binds glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ligands. EPHA7 is composed of one tyrosine kinase domain and an extracellular domain that contains a ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and two fibronectin type III repeats (PMID 10197531, 9883737). EPHA7 structurally resembles other members of the Eph family and is associated with promoting cellular transformation, invasion, and proliferation through the JAK2 signaling pathway (PMID: 24003208, 20179713, 22862837). Differential expression levels of EPHA7 and diverse roles in carcinogenesis have been shown in various cancer types (PMID: 26160986). Studies have shown overexpression of EPHA7 in glioblastoma, breast, and gallbladder adenocarcinoma, which promotes cell proliferation and migration through the FGFR1 signaling pathway and is correlated with poor prognosis (PMID 18790757, 15147954, 18366728). Other studies have shown downregulation of EPHA7 by hypermethylation in gastric, colorectal, esophageal squamous cell and prostate cancers, as well as in follicular lymphomas; and its association with tumor progression (PMID 17669470, 16007213, 26160986, 18821581, 29022918, 22036564).	true

EPHB1 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the ephrin (EPH) protein family (PMID: 31297055). EPH receptors bind to ephrin ligands on adjacent cells, resulting in cell interaction-dependent bidirectional signaling, which activates forward signaling in cells expressing the EPH receptor and reverse signaling in ligand presenting cells (PMID: 31297055). EPHB1 is a marker of venous endothelial cells and has been found to mediate signaling in a variety of contexts including in cell positioning of colorectal cells (PMID: 12408869, 21235905). EPHB signaling has been implicated in a variety of other cellular processes including immune regulation, epithelial integrity, invasion, cell shape, cellular proliferation and axon guidance (PMID: 12408869, 18424888, 31297055, 26790531, 23669443, 21514363). Differential EPHB1 signaling has been associated with inflammatory intestinal disorders, such as Crohnâs disease (PMID: 15996027). Somatic mutations in EPHB1 are found in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (PMID: 12408869). These mutations are predicted to be loss-of-function and disrupt epithelial cell adhesion and cellular compartmentalization, leading to metastatic progression (PMID: 12408869). Reduced expression of EPHB1 has also been detected in a variety of cancers including colorectal, gastric, and ovarian cancer, among others (PMID: 18931529, 18424888).	true

EPHB4, a member of the ephrin family of receptors, encodes for a transmembrane receptor kinase that functions primarily in regulating angiogenesis, erythropoiesis and vasculogenesis (PMID: 10518221, 16424904, 10603345). EFNB2 binds to EPHB4 to activate the bi-directional ephrin signaling pathway and triggers a signaling cascade for cellular motility by either attracting or repelling cells (PMID: 31949258). Overexpression of EPHB4 in various cancer cell lines and models induces increased cellular survival and tumor growth, suggesting that EPHB4 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 16816380, 29296810, 15153337, 26073592). Amplification of EPHB4 has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer and esophageal squamous cell cancer (PMID: 16816380, 31934189, 31885720).	false

EPOR is a type I cytokine receptor that binds erythropoietin (EPO) (PMID: 17721432, 17124066). EPO initiates red blood cell production by binding EPOR, which is expressed predominantly on erythroid progenitors (PMID: 21307776). EPO-engagement of EPOR results in activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase JAK2, leading to the recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as STAT3 and STAT5 (PMID: 17721432, 17124066). Subsequent phosphorylation of STAT proteins enables the translocation of these signaling molecules to the nucleus to activate transcription (PMID: 17721432). EPO-mediated activation of JAK-STAT signaling regulates several cellular functions including proliferation, erythroid differentiation, and apoptosis (PMID: 12239135). Mice lacking expression of EPOR have defective primitive and definitive erythropoiesis, resulting in embryonic lethality (PMID: 23894012, 12239135). Germline EPOR gain-of-function mutations have been identified in patients with familial erythrocytosis and congenital polycythemia (PMID: 8506290, 7795221, 24115288, 27982410). Recurrent EPOR fusion proteins are found in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that results in truncated, active EPOR molecules (PMID: 22897847, 28972016, 26859458, 27870571). Expression of truncated EPOR proteins in hematopoietic assays results in EPO hypersensitivity and transformation (PMID: 26859458). EPOR alterations result in hyperactive JAK-STAT signaling and sensitivity to small molecule JAK2 inhibition (PMID: 26859458).	false

ERBB2 (also HER2) is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB3, and ERBB4. ERBB2 does not directly bind its own ligand; instead, it potentiates the activity of other ligand-bound ERBB receptors by binding to them (PMID: 12620236). ERBB2 can heterodimerize with any of the other EGFR family receptors (PMID: 10220407, 9130710) initiating downstream signaling activation of several pathways including the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades (PMID: 22239438, 12853564). ERBB2 can also homodimerize and initiate MAPK, SRC, PI3K and STAT signaling (PMID: 22785351). Activation of ERBB2-mediated signaling ultimately results in cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation (PMID: 18045542). ERBB2 is activated by gene amplification and overexpression in a range of human cancers including breast, gastric, and endometrial tumors, among others (PMID: 19536107, 24656976). ERBB2 gene amplification in human breast cancers is associated with poor overall survival and time to tumor recurrence (PMID: 3798106, 23000897,9552035, 9469329). Amplified ERBB2 heterodimerizes with ERBB3 to activate oncogenic signaling and drives tumorigenesis in breast cancer (PMID:12853564, 23204226, 12124352, 18632642). Somatic mutations in ERBB2 have been identified in a series of tumors including lobular breast, lung adenocarcinoma, and gastric cancers, among others, with recurrent hotspot alterations in both the extracellular and kinase domains (PMID: 23000897, 23220880, 22908275). Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that many of these mutations are transforming and sensitive to FDA-approved ERBB targeted therapies, including trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, lapatinib, and pertuzumab (PMID:24799465).	false

ERBB3 (also HER3) is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4 (PMID: 19536107, 11252954, 19208461). ERBB3 is unique in that it has limited kinase activity, approximately 1000 fold less than its family member, EGFR (PMID: 8389462, 8058764, 20351256). Thereby, ERBB3 cannot form homodimers (PMID: 15225657) and must heterodimerize with other ERBB family members to initiate downstream signaling (PMID: 8632008). Heterodimerization of ERBB3 with its preferred heterodimer partner, ERBB2, results in activation of several signaling pathways, including the MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, SRC, and STAT pathways (PMID: 7515147, 8026468, 8264617). Preclinical models of ERBB2-amplified cancers demonstrate that ERBB2-amplified cells exquisitely rely on ERBB3 to drive proliferation and survival (PMID: 12853564, 24651011, 19536107). Moreover, ERBB3 feedback upregulation, localization changes, and ligand overexpression contribute to resistance to ERBB or PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors (PMID: 24520092, 24651011, 19536107). Overexpression of ERBB3 has been correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in some human cancers (PMID: 20179223, 20816829). Somatic activating mutations in ERBB3 are found in gastric, bladder, uterine and colorectal cancers, among others (PMID: 23680147). While that are no FDA-approved inhibitors for ERBB3-mutated cancers, preclinical and clinical trials are underway to determine if ERBB targeting compounds alone or in combination with other inhibitors targeting the MAPK pathway are efficacious.	false

Binding of ERBB4 by its ligands, including neuregulins (NRG1-4), betacellulin (BTC), HB-EGF or epiregulin (EPR), activates the receptor and initiates downstream signaling pathways including the canonical MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades. ERBB4 forms active kinase dimers with other ERBB isoforms, including the preferential binding partner ERRB2 (PMID: 9130710, 10220407,19208461, 11252954). Somatic activating mutations in ERBB4 have been identified in melanoma (PMID: 22817889, 22842228, 24755198), lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 18948947), gastric (PMID: 25079317, 25583476), and colorectal cancers (PMID: 22895193); however, the role of ERBB4 in cancer is not well established. Evidence in breast cancer cell lines suggests that ERBB4 is not required for mediating tumorigenesis in ERBB2-positive breast cancer but rather for mediating resistance to ERBB2 inhibitors (PMID: 25590338). Conversely, a subset of literature points to a growth-suppressive role for ERBB4 in breast cancer (PMID: 17120616, 24791013, 16832345, 20603612). The prognostic value of ERBB4 expression in cancer is still debatable, as reports have documented both better and worse outcomes in these tumors; however, this may be due to the lack of discrimination between ERBB4 variants (PMID: 25492965, 18454307).	false

ERC1 associates with the scaffold proteins PPFIA1, also known as liprin-alpha-1, and LL5Î² to form plasma membrane-associated platforms (PMAPs) on the cellular membrane to support protrusion, cellular motility and invasion (PMID: 37437062). ERC1 is a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex and promotes NF-ÎºB expression by recruiting IÎºBÎ± to the complex (PMID: 15218148). Overexpression of ERC1 in A549 and HEK293T cells activates NF-kB and other proinflammatory genes as well as increases cellular migration, suggesting that ERC1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 37252973).

ERCC2 is a DNA helicase that is a member of the RAD3/XPD family of protein helicases. ERCC2 is a regulator of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway; NER is used by cells to repair bulky DNA lesions that are caused by environmental mutagens, UV irradiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin (reviewed in PMID: 24086042). ERCC2 functions as an ATP-dependent 5' to 3' helicase that unwinds damaged DNA, enabling other NER factors to access the DNA for subsequent repair (PMID: 9351836). Germline mutations of ERCC2 lead to trichothiodystrophy, xeroderma pigmentosum and combined xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome (reviewed in PMID: 19809470). Genetic polymorphisms of ERCC2 are associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, including lung (PMID: 20651612), colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 16707649) and urothelial cell carcinoma (PMID: 24347488). Somatic ERCC2 mutations occur in approximately 12% of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and have been associated with response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibition (PMID: 24476821, 25096233, 29489427).	true

ERCC3 functions to unwind the DNA double helix which is required as part of the nucleotide-excision repair (NER) pathway (PMID: 21571596, 8465201, 8107888, 21571596). The TFIIH transcriptional complex also requires activity of ERCC3 for initiation of transcription (PMID: 8152490, 7613092, 8166891).

ERG fusions are the most common alterations of the ERG gene and are found in several cancers, including prostate cancer (PMID: 16254181) and Ewingâs sarcoma (PMID: 8162068). In prostate cancer, approximately 50% of all cases harbor a fusion between ERG and a highly expressed gene (e.g., TMPRSS2) that leads to aberrant overexpression of ERG (PMID: 16254181). In these cases, ERG acts to modify the chromatin landscape of prostate cancer cells, allowing for increased androgen receptor (AR) binding and priming prostate cancer initiation in response to PTEN loss (PMID: 23817021, 28783165).	false

CDC42 binding to ERRFI1 mediates the inhibitory activity on EGF receptor family members (PMID: 10749885, 17599051, 12833145). ERRFI1 regulates many cellular processes including cell signaling, development, tissue homeostasis, and stress response (PMID: 16087873, 19683494, 16782890, 22975324, 22912762, 19710174, 12384522). Murine loss-of-function studies have demonstrated that ERRFI1 is a regulator of keratinocyte development and proliferation (PMID: 17987665). In addition, ERRFI1 loss promotes cancer progression in mouse models, suggesting that ERRFI1 functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 16648858, 16819504, 25735773, 29191600). Deletion and downregulation of ERRFI1 have been implicated in various cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma, among others, and is an indicator of poor patient outcome (PMID: 20044804, 21113414, 19439667, 20351267, 10862041, 25753424, 10987304, 15900585, 9287966).

ESCO2 is an enzyme that establishes sister chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle (PMID: 15958495). Cohesion between sister chromatids is initiated during DNA replication and must be maintained throughout mitosis or meiosis to ensure proper chromosome-spindle attachments (PMID: 26903600). ESCO2 functions as an acetyltransferase during S phase that acetylates the cohesin component SMC3 and allows for appropriate cohesion distribution (PMID: 18501190). The enzymatic activity of ESCO2 is required for accurate pairing of sister chromatids during cell division and DNA repair (PMID: 22614755). Loss of ESCO2 in cell lines results in premature sister chromatid separation and apoptosis (PMID: 22614755). In addition, ESCO2 forms complexes with several chromatin modifying enzymes, functioning as a transcriptional co-repressor and is bound at pericentric heterochromatin (PMID: 22101327,18501190, 26305936).

ESR1 is a nuclear receptor that encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) protein. ERÎ± plays a major role in sexual reproductive development and maintenance, specifically in the female reproductive organs (PMID: 10368776). Binding of the hormone estrogen, the ERÎ± ligand, induces conformational changes to ERÎ±, which allows the receptor to dissociate from HSP90 and dimerize with itself or ERÎ². The dimer then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to promoters and enhancers of target genes either directly, via Estrogen Responsive Elements (ERE) in the DNA, or via other transcription factor complexes such as FOS/JUN/SP-1 (PMID: 11162939, 10681512). Once bound, the estrogen receptor recruits co-regulators that modulate the transcription of ESR1 target genes, resulting in changes in proliferation, migration and differentiation (PMID: 21779010). Lack of ERÎ± delays the development of WNT1- and ERBB2 mutant-induced mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 10213494, 12019156) and reduces the occurrence of estrogen and carcinogen-induced mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 20181624, 11156389), indicating the involvement of ERÎ± in tumorigenesis. While mutations in ESR1 are generally very rare in primary cancers (<5%), a number of mutations occurring in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the receptor were identified in ~12-25% of hormone-resistant metastatic breast cancer patients (PMID: 24398047, 24185512, 24185510, 24217577). The most recurrent mutations, Y537S and D538G, result in a constitutively active receptor, which is shown to confer acquired resistance to estrogen deprivation therapies.	false

ETAA1 (also ETAA16) is a replication stress protein that promotes fork progression (PMID: 27601467, 27723717, 27723720). In response to replication stress, ETAA1 binds RPA (Replication Protein Complex A), a complex that associates with single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks and recruits repair proteins to resolve the forks (PMID: 27601467, 27723720, 27818175). The activity of ETAA1 stimulates ATR, a protein kinase involved in DNA sensing (PMID: 27601467), via a distinct arm independent from TOPBP1-mediated repair (PMID: 27723717, 30139873). Specifically, ETAA1 associates with two distinct replication complexes including ATR/ATRIP and BLM/TOP3Î±/RMI1/RMI2 (PMID: 27723720). Loss of ETAA1 results in genome instability, altered DNA replication and sensitivity to replication stress (PMID: 27723717, 27723720). In addition, reduced ETAA1 expression in murine models results in a diminished T-cell response, suggesting that ETAA1 may have a role in immune cell regulation (PMID: 28607084). ETAA1 is also predicted to function as a surface antigen in Ewing sarcoma (PMID: 16003559). Variants associated with ETAA1 are predictive of susceptibility to pancreatic and colon cancer (PMID: 26098869, 29844832).	true

ETNK1 is a kinase that catalyzes the first step in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis pathway (PMID: 13366993). ETNK1 phosphorylates ethanolamine to form phosphoethanolamine, an intermediate which is then processed to PE, a membrane phospholipid (PMID: 13366993, 25343957). PE has a variety of cellular roles including maintaining membrane protein topology, defining membrane architecture, anchoring PE-binding proteins to the membrane as well as regulation of cytokinesis and mitochondrial respiration (PMID: 19703652, 11294902). Somatic ETNK1 mutations are found in BCR-ABL negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (PMID: 25343957, 25615281).	false

ETS1, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, encodes for a transcription factor that functions in the regulation of various lymphoid cell processes, including survival, differentiation and proliferation, through transcriptional regulation of chemokines and cytokines (PMID: 10698492, 11909962, 32350509, 27069114). Alternative spliced transcript variants of ETS1 have been identified and can result in the p42 isoform, a gain-of-function protein that lacks the autoinhibitory sequences, or the p27 isoform, a dominant negative protein that lacks transactivation activity (PMID: 19377509, 8003962). The oncogenic function of ETS1 is likely tissue-specific. Overexpression of ETS1 in breast cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation, invasion and migration, suggesting that ETS1 can function as an oncogene in this context (PMID: 24706481, 21444677, 22971289). ETS1 amplification has been identified in various types of cancer, including ovarian cancer and prostate cancer (PMID: 11297247, 23064684). Conversely, knockout of ETS1 in other breast cancer cell studies induces cellular proliferation and aberrant lymphoid cell development, suggesting that ETS1 can function as a tumor suppressor gene in this context (PMID: 32477936). Ectopic expression of wildtype ETS1 and the p42 isoform in colorectal and epithelial cancer cell lines induces apoptosis and has been suggested as a potential therapeutic treatment (PMID: 9266972, 7753825). Preclinical studies with breast cancer cell lines overexpressing ETS1 have demonstrated conferral of multidrug resistance (PMID: 20392592).	true

The ETV1 (ETS Translocation Variant 1) gene, belongs to the ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors. The downstream transcriptional targets of ETV1 are diverse and tissue specific. ETV1 is a downstream transcriptional mediator of the MAP kinase pathway and it is tightly regulated by the MAP kinase through transcription, protein stability, and phosphorylation (PMID: 12213813, 19251651, 20927104). The endogenous expression of ETV1 is restricted to several tissues, including specific neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems (PMID: 16289830, 21746923, 10850491) and the interstitial cells of Cajal (âpacemakerâ cells of the gastrointestinal tract) (PMID: 20927104). ETV1 is aberrantly activated in several cancers through distinct mechanisms: In Ewing sarcoma, ETV1 is fused with the EWS protein to generate the chimeric EWS-ETV1 protein. In prostate cancer, ETV1 is aberrantly over-expressed through translocation resulting in either fusion transcript or full-length transcript. In melanoma, ETV1 is aberrantly over-expressed through genetic amplification of its chromosomal locus. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), ETV1 is endogenously highly expressed and required to maintain lineage specification and survival (PMID: 7700648, 17671502, 20160028, 20927104).	false

ETV4 (also PEA3 and E1AF) is a transcription factor that belongs to the ETS family of transcription factors. The family consists of a highly conserved group of genes that play important roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis (PMID: 21548782). ETV4 in particular plays an important role in development, such as in organogenesis of the kidney, mammary gland, and limb buds (PMID: 9285689, 12871699, 19386269). ETV4 is overexpressed in various types of solid cancers, including the esophagus (PMID: 21143918), colon (PMID: 15695237), breast (PMID: 21404275,15387369), ovarian (PMID:12684413), non-small lung (PMID: 11519038) and gastric (PMID: 14604892), where it promotes metastatic progression and correlates with reduced survival. In prostate cancers (~1% of the cases) ETV4 overexpression is associated with translocation of ETV4 to the promoter of a gene highly expressed in prostate (TMPRSS2, KLK2, DDX5, and CANT1) (PMID: 18794152, 16585160, 18451133). Finally, fusions of ETV4 with Ewing's sarcoma (EWSR1) gene have been reported in three cases of Ewing sarcoma (ES) (PMID: 8834175, 8605035, 22429598). The defining feature of this tumor type is chromosomal translocation involving the EWSR1 gene and one of five ETS genes.	false

ETV5 is an ETS family transcription factor belonging to the PEA3 subfamily involved in multiple cellular processes. PEA3 family members are activated by pathways such as the MAPK and PKA pathway to induce the transcription of gene programs through phosphorylation (PMID: 8895521, 8808707). ETV4 and ETV5 are involved in the proliferation of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and subsequent induction of differentiation cascades, potentially through changes in Oct3/4 expression (PMID: 26224636). Additionally, ETV5 has been shown to be expressed during embryonic development, especially at sites undergoing branching morphogenesis (PMID: 12871699, 19898483, 19386268). In the testis, ETV5 is exclusively expressed in the Sertoli cells and is required for spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal (PMID: 16107850).	false

ETV6 is a transcription factor that is a member of the ETS protein family. The ETS family is one of the largest families of transcription factors. ETS domains typically bind to a GGAA/T DNA sequence, but can also be involved in protein-protein interactions (PMID: 11175367). ETV6 is essential for hematopoietic stem cells (PMID: 17980166) and may initiate the regulatory cascade leading to their production (PMID: 20412772). Translocations involving band 12p13 around ETV6 are one of the most commonly observed alterations in hematological malignancies (PMID: 22578774). ETV6 has a large number of fusion partners and typically contributes to tumorigenesis by modifying the activity or function of the partner gene or a proto-oncogene close to a translocation site (PMID: 22578774). Somatic mutations occur at a relatively low frequency in solid tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2016). Germline ETV6 mutations contribute to hematologic malignancies including ALL (PMID: 25581430, 26573422). ETV6-NTRK3 fusion has been shown to be sensitive to crizotinib (PMID: 25207766).	true

EWSR1 is one of three members of the highly conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (hnRNP) protein family, FET (PMID: 25494299, 22081015). The EWSR1 protein can bind to DNA or RNA and is known to play a role in transcription via binding to RNA Pol II, RNA processing and metabolism, and DNA damage repair (PMID: 24320889, 25494299). The N-terminal domain of EWSR1 can fuse to the C-terminal domain of a number of transcription factors and give rise to several fusion proteins that have been implicated in Ewing Sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, myxoid liposarcoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and clear cell sarcoma (PMID: 16784984, 25364450, 17691072, 17525681, 17227118, 24320889).	false

EXT1 (Exostoses-1) is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase which is required for the polymerization of heparan sulfate (HS)(PMID: 9756849). HS polymerization is necessary for the formation of fibronectin fibrils and the subsequent formation of the insoluble cell-matrix (PMID: 34890641). The reduction of EXT1, therefore, leads to reduced fibril assembly and global changes in cellular homeostasis, including increased cell size, ER structure and changes to membrane glycome and lipid compositions, which impact the metabolism of the cell (PMID: 33962942). Mutations in EXT1 are associated with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), an autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized by the formation of osteochondromas and an increased risk for chondro- and osteosarcoma (PMID: 7550340). While somatic mutations of EXT1 are rare in sporadic neoplasms, EXT1 expression can be reduced by the hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter, which has been found as a method of EXT1 loss in cell lines from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-melanoma skin cancer (PMID: 15385438).	true

EZH1 is the catalytic component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which methylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), resulting in chromatin compaction and target gene repression. Compared to its homolog, EZH2, EZH1-containing PRC2 complexes show weaker methylation activity, target fewer genes, and are more abundant in non-proliferative adult organs (PMID: 19026781). EZH1 plays a role in maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency (PMID: 19026780). EZH1 is not commonly altered in cancer, but recurrent mutations in EZH1 are often the second hit in autonomous thyroid adenomas (PMID: 27500488).

EZH2 is the catalytic component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which is responsible for transcriptional repression by catalyzing di- and tri-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). EZH2 requires other members of the PRC2 complex for full methyltransferase activity, including SUZ12 and EED (PMID: 15225548, 15916951), and PRC2 function is important in repression of developmental regulators such as the HOX genes, and X-inactivation (PMID: 16618801, 12649488). Additionally, non-coding RNA's can guide EZH2 to genomic targets for gene repression (PMID: 17604720, 22659877). EZH2 overexpression is found in many malignancies including lymphoma, bladder cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer, and is associated with advanced stage and poor prognosis (PMID: 11389032, 16361539, 12374981, 14500907, 16330673, 24097870). Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in EZH2 occur frequently in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (PMID: 20081860, 21190999). EZH2 can also act as a tumor suppressor in certain cancer types, and recurrent inactivating mutations are observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (PMID: 20601953). Given its importance in multiple cancer types, EZH2 inhibition has shown promise in pre-clinical studies and is a current effort in multiple clinical trials, either through direct inhibition of EZH2 enzymatic activity or through disruption in PRC2 stability (PMID: 26845405).	true

EZHIP is a protein encoded from a single exon on the X chromosome (PMID: 23959973, 27699219). The function of EZHIP is not well-established, however, biochemical studies indicate that EZHIP interacts with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (PMID: 21248841). The PRC2 complex catalyzes the tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a mark important for mediating repression of gene expression (PMID: 21248841). Loss of in neuronal cells results in reduced H3K27me3 and decreased cell growth (PMID: 29909548). In addition, EZHIP is most highly expressed in normal oocytes (PMID: 23959973) and may function as a cancer testis antigen (CTA) to mediate immune recognition in lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 27699219). Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements involving EZHIP and MBTD1, a Polycomb protein with uncharacterized function, are found in patients with low grade endometrial stromal sarcomas (PMID: 23959973).

FANCC is a DNA repair protein that is a member of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group (PMID: 21605559). The FA core complex, which includes FANCC and 7 other FA proteins, assemble at sites of damaged chromatin and coordinate the DNA repair response (PMID: 27145721). By scaffolding with BRCA1/2 proteins, the FA core complex facilitates homologous combination via repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks (PMID: 21605559, 16687415). The FA pathway is activated in response to cellular stress, which interrupts replication and transcription (PMID: 23114602). Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 by the core FA complex is required to mediate DNA repair (PMID: 17352736). FANCC directly interacts with transcriptional regulators, such as the co-repressor C-terminal binding protein 1 (Ctbp1) and Î²-catenin, to modulate gene expression and signaling (PMID: 23303816, 24469828). In addition, FANCC activity is important in several cellular functions including redox regulation, proliferation, genomic stability and apoptosis (PMID: 15327776). Germline mutations in FANCC are found in patients with FA, an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome associated with deficiencies in hematopoietic stem cells, developmental defects, and cancer predisposition (PMID: 24469828). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations have been associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (PMID: 23779253, 31467304). Furthermore, inactivating mutations in FANCC have been observed in leukemia, oral, breast, and pancreatic cancers, among others (PMID: 16998502, 27165003).

FANCD2 functions predominantly as a heterodimer in collaboration with FANCI; this complex recruits effector molecules to regions of damaged DNA (PMID: 27405460, 17412408). The FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer is activated via ubiquitination and phosphorylation by components of the Fanconi anemia core complex, including the kinases ATR, ATM, and CHK1 and the E3 ligases FANCL and FANCT (PMID: 29376519). Following DNA repair completion, monoubiquitination of FANCD2-FANCI is reversed by a deubiquitinase complex, resulting in the removal of FANCD2-FANCI from chromatin (PMID: 15694335). FANCD2 has been implicated in various cellular functions including maintenance of cell cycle progression, genomic stability, mitotic apparatus assembly and spindle integrity (PMID: 23934222, 29376519).

These proteins coordinate homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage, specifically interstrand DNA crosslinks, by localizing to the site of damage using the BRCA1/2 proteins as a scaffold (PMID: 21605559). Essential for this DNA repair is monoubiquitinated, activated FANCD2 (PMID: 17352736). Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 relies on a nuclear complex of several FA proteins, including FANCL, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG and FANCM; FANCL is the ubiquitin ligase required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination and its resulting HRR activity (PMID: 26149689, 31666700, 27986371, 20154706). Loss of FANCL in the germline can result in Fanconi Anemia, a cancer-predisposing syndrome characterized by hematological abnormalities, bone marrow failure, limb deformities, skin hyperpigmentation and susceptibility to hematologic and solid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 24773018, 25754594). Hematological abnormalities in FA patients may be due in part to the role of FANCL in regulating Î²-catenin (PMID: 22653977). FANCL is mutated somatically in various cancers including head and neck carcinoma, among others (PMID: 28678401). FANCL loss and the resulting deficiency in HRR may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, which is FDA-approved for patients with HRR-deficient prostate cancer (PMID: 32343890).	true	
ENST00000267430	NM_020937	ENST00000267430	NM_020937	57697	FANCM	false			FANCM, a DNA repair protein, is infrequently altered in cancer.	FANCM (FA complementation group M) encodes for a DNA translocase with DNA-dependent ATPase activity (PMID: 30714416, 20117061, 31663812). FANCM is involved in homologous recombination and repair of interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs) (PMID: 30714416, 20117061). FANCM participates in the proper functioning of the Fanconi anemia pathway, which helps to suppress the formation of tumors (PMID: 31663812).  FANCM also regulates the Bloomâs complex, a complex of proteins in which germline mutations can lead to the cancer predisposition disorder Bloomâs Syndrome (PMID: 31663812). Loss of function of the FANCM gene has not been associated with Fanconi anemia, but rather with infertility and cancer predisposition (PMID: 30714416). The gene is also essential for the viability of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) cancers (PMID: 31663812). FANCM mutations have been identified in patients with breast and ovarian cancers  (PMID: 30714416, 36707629).	true	
ENST00000355740	NM_000043.4	ENST00000652046	NM_000043.6	355	FAS	false			FAS, a death receptor that initiates apoptosis, is recurrently altered by mutation or downregulation in a diverse range of human cancers.	FAS (also FAS1, CD95, APO-1) is a death receptor that mediates apoptosis (PMID: 20505730). FAS binds the cognate ligand CD95L, a protein predominantly expressed on T and NK cells, resulting in the death of the associated cell expressing the FAS receptor (PMID: 22042271). The FAS-CD95L interaction results in the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex that includes FADD, caspase 8, and caspase 10 (PMID: 12393594). Proteolytic processing of caspases then triggers a cascade that initiates apoptosis (PMID: 28445729, 28445729). FAS can also activate other downstream signaling cascades, including activation of the NF-KB and JNK pathways (PMID: 8647190). Loss of FAS expression in several murine models of cancer, including ovarian and liver, results in reduced apoptosis and enhanced tumor growth (PMID: 20505730). Germline mutations in FAS are associated with an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, a disorder associated with chronic lymphadenopathy and an increased risk of lymphoma development (PMID: 7540117, 11418480). Cell surface levels of FAS are frequently downregulated in cancer, allowing cells to evade programmed cell death (PMID: 15907590). Somatic FAS mutations are also found in a variety of tumor types including multiple myeloma, lymphomas, T cell leukemias, and several solid tumor types (PMID: 9373236, 9787134, 10190897, 11059754, 22042271). Mutations are frequently heterozygous and are predicted to be loss-of-function, allowing tumors to evade cell death via apoptosis (PMID: 22042271).	true

FAT1 is a transmembrane protein and member of the cadherin superfamily that is involved in planar cell polarity. FAT1 is involved in the promotion of actin-mediated cell migration as well as inhibition of YAP1-mediated cell proliferation. FAT1 is a potent suppressor of cancer cell growth, owing to its ability to bind Î²-catenin and abrogate its nuclear localization and transcription of its targets. Alterations in FAT1 decrease its interaction with Î²-catenin, thus promoting WNT signaling and tumorigenesis. Although most FAT1 alterations in cancer are loss-of-function events (cBioPortal, MSKCC, May 2015), studies suggest that it may be both tumor suppressive or oncogenic in a context-dependent manner (PMID: 8586420, 23076869,19439659, 16682528, 23354438).	true

FBXO11 is an F-box protein that is a subunit of the ubiquitin ligase SCF complex (SKP1-cullin-F-box). FBXO11 is an essential component of the SCF complex which ubiquitinates substrate proteins and targets them for degradation via the proteasome (PMID: 22113614). FBXO11 directly binds SKP1 in the SCF complex and mediates substrate specific recognition (PMID: 16633365). BCL6 is a well-characterized target of SCF-mediated degradation and disruption of this complex results in BCL6 protein stabilization and transformation (PMID: 22113614). Loss of FBXO11 expression in murine models results in an expansion of germinal center B cells due to an overexpression of BCL6 (PMID: 27166359). FBXO11 also mediates the stability of other proteins, including SNAIL, a factor involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (PMID: 25203322). Alterations in FBXO11 have been identified in patients with neurological disorders (PMID: 29796876, 30057029). Somatic FBXO11 deletions and loss-of-function mutations are found in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL), leading to stabilization of the BCL6 oncogene (PMID: 22113614).	true	
ENST00000608872	NM_012164	ENST00000608872	NM_012164	26190	FBXW2	false			FBXW2, the substrate binding unit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is infrequently altered in cancer.	FBXW2 is the substrate binding unit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex known as SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) (PMID: 30918250). FBXW2 is an F-box protein containing WD-40 repeats that is responsible for substrate recognition, substrate binding and substrate specificity for the SCF complex (PMID: 30918250). The binding of SCF to its target proteins results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein (PMID: 30918250). Thus, FBXW2 plays a pivotal role in post-translational protein regulation in the cell. FBXW2 is responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of proto-oncogenic substrates such as CTNNB1 (PMID: 30918250, 31211237), SKP2 (PMID: 31211237, 28090088), NF-ÎºB p65 (PMID: 34465889) and EGFR (PMID: 35499593), which are instrumental in oncogenic processes in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer (PMID: 30918250, 31211237, 28090088, 34465889, 35499593). However, FBXW2 also downregulates inhibitory proteins of the SOX2 transcription factor and therefore plays a role in promoting cell stemness (PMID: 31548378), suggesting FBXW2 may have both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles.	false	
ENST00000281708	NM_033632.3	ENST00000281708	NM_033632.3	55294	FBXW7	false			FBXW7, a tumor suppressor involved in protein degradation, is inactivated by mutation in various cancer types, most frequently in endometrial and colorectal cancers.	The FBXW7 gene encodes an F-box protein subunit involved in substrate recognition by an SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein)-type ubiquitin ligase complex. Upon substrate identification, this complex modifies the substrate such that it is targeted for protein degradation. Substrates of FBXW7 include the proteins c-MYC, mTOR (PMID: 18787170), NOTCH1, cyclin-E, and JUN, which are instrumental in the regulation of cell division, differentiation and growth, and which are often inappropriately activated in cancer. As most FBXW7 substrates are proto-oncogenes that are processed for degradation by the SCF complex, FBXW7 functions as a tumor suppressor. Inactivation of FBXW7 by mutation or copy number loss results in aberrant accumulation of oncoproteins, which subsequently contributes to malignant transformation (PMID: 18094723, 27399335). Alternate splicing of FBXW7 results in three distinct protein isoforms (Î±, Î², Î³) each with differential localization (PMID: 22673505). Mutations in FBXW7 can negatively affect isoform-specific functions, dimerization of subunits, protein localization, SCF assembly or substrate recognition. Most mutations in FBXW7 are point mutations that disrupt substrate binding, while <10% are small deletions or insertions (PMID: 24853181, 17909001).	true

FES encodes for a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that functions in the maintenance of cellular transformation (PMID: 15003822). FES is located downstream of cell surface receptors FCER1 and KIT, regulating functions such as cellular differentiation, cell attachment and mast cell signaling (PMID: 11509660, 8999909, 22589410). Mast cell development is controlled by FES through regulation of cross-talk between KIT and Î²1 integrins to promote cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility (PMID: 19892014). Knockdown of FES in various cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that FES functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 19082481, 28952025). FES overexpression has been identified in various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer (PMID: 1984516, 1159660). Inhibition of FES is suggested to induce radiosensitization in cancer (PMID: 31573955).	false

FEV is a transcription factor belonging to the ETS protein family. In normal cells, FEV expression is restricted to a small number of tissues and is thought to act as a transcriptional repressor, as it lacks the N-terminal transcription activation domain found in other ETS family members (PMID: 9121764). However, FEV has also been shown to co-localize with serotonin-producing and cholinergic neurons and be involved in the transcriptional activation of genes in that context. Specific genes involved in neurotransmission, differentiation, and maintenance of neuronal cell types, such as the serotonin transporter and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, among others, are activated through enhancers containing FEV binding motifs (PMID: 9468386, 10575032). Fusions of FEV with EWSR1, another ETS protein family member, are found as rare chromosomal rearrangements in Ewing Sarcoma (PMID:10976720, 23329308, 9121764).	false

FGF10, a member of the FGF family, encodes for a fibroblast growth factor which functions primarily in mesenchymal-epithelial signaling to promote organ development, tissue repair and cellular differentiation (PMID: 12455635, 11748146, 19498056). FGF10 signals in a paracrine manner through activating FGFR2 and FGFR1 (PMID: 24011590, 16597617). FGF10 expression in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that FGF10 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 18594526, 25057305). Amplification of FGF10 has been identified in various types of cancer, including gastric cancer, small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer (PMID: 26268776, 29748005, 26909576). Preclinical studies have demonstrated FGF10 sensitivity to N-myristoyltransferase inhibitors and inactivation of the FGF10-FGFR2 signaling axis in prostate cancer cell lines (PMID: 14724220, 29038344, 29444487).	false

FGF14 mutations and haploinsufficiency have been associated with increased risk of cognitive disorders, like schizophrenia, due to dysregulation of the central nervous system (PMID: 27163207, 36516086, 17236779). Overexpression of FGF14 in various cancer cell lines and models suppresses cellular proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting that FGF14 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 32707902, 31949485).

FGF3 belongs to the FGF7 subfamily which includes FGF3, FGF7, FGF10 and FGF22 (PMID: 26369258). For inner ear, FGF3 has fallen into and out of favor as a potential ear-specific inducer. Excess FGF3 can induce the formation of extra otic vesicles (ear rings), whereas insufficient FGF3 can block their formation in chick (PMID: 10906788, 10769226). FGF3 has been identified as a main target of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) insertional activation in mouse mammary tumors (PMID: 6327073).

FGF4 belongs to the human fibroblast growth factor family which was originally identified in NIH3T3 transfection assays using human stomach cancer or Kaposi sarcoma derived genomic DNA (PMID: 9715278). In adult and malignant tissues, FGF4 expression is tightly regulated. FGF4 expression is restricted to undifferentiated human embryonal carcinomas (ECs). During induced differentiation, FGF4 expression is repressed (PMID: 9715278). FGF4 gene amplification has been observed in numerous human carcinomas such as breast carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and the oesophagus, epithelial ovarian tumors and bladder cancers (PMID: 10368635, 9816285, 9380415, 1532244, 1361954).

FGFR1 is widely expressed and is necessary for a variety of cellular functions such as embryonic development, skeletogenesis, mitogenesis and differentiation. Cell-type specific FGFR1 regulation is dependent on tissue distribution and ligand availability (PMID: 16597617). Germline mutations in FGFR1 are associated with congenic disorders that present with physical malformations, mental retardation and neurologic deficits (PMID: 23812909).

Germline mutations of FH are associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer.	FH (fumarate hydratase, also known as fumarase) is an enzyme that converts fumarate to malate as part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. FH exists in a mitochondrial and a cytosolic form, the former of which carries out FH's canonical role in the TCA cycle and the latter of which is likely involved in amino acid metabolism (PMID: 23643539, 14708972). The mitochondrial form of FH is determined by a C-terminal signal sequence (PMID: 18577574). Heterozygous germline mutations of FH cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple cutaneous piloleiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas and papillary type 2 renal cancer (PMID: 20618355, 11865300, 15937070, 12772087, 16155190). Individuals with this disease are at risk for developing cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, a form kidney cancer (PMID: 19470762). In HLRCC, tumor formation occurs following the inactivation of the wildtype allele, and therefore FH is classified as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 16155190, 20618355). Somatic FH mutations are sporadically found in other cancer types.

The most common alterations in FHIT are deletions, DNA hypermethylation, abnormal transcripts, and reduced expression (PMID: 11562178, 24370550), and loss of FHIT has been documented in various cancers including lung, esophageal, cervical, and breast cancers (PMID: 19086848, 11562178, 30941950, 9823304). FHIT plays a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis as overexpression of FHIT in osteosarcoma cells results in inhibition of proliferation and increased apoptosis (PMID: 30655842).	true

Germline mutations of FLCN are associated with Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome and predispose to renal cell carcinomas.	FLCN is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagC/D GTPase proteins involved in amino acid sensing and signaling to mTORC1 (PMID:24095279). Varying cellular processes have been implicated with its function including regulation of oxidative metabolism at the mitochondria, mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy (PMID:23150719, 24762438, 25126726). Mutations can activate the mTOR pathway and AKT signaling (PMID:19850877, 24908670). FLCN mutations are found in Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome which is characterized by fibrofolliculomas, pneumothorax, and renal cell carcinomas (PMID: 22146830,15956655).

FLI1, an ETS family transcription factor, is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in lineage commitment and development (PMID: 11715049, 10891501). Specifically, FLI1 modulates the response of erythroid cells to erythropoietin (Epo), a major cytokine and regulator of erythropoiesis. FLI1 inhibits Epo-induced differentiation of primary erythroblasts by binding and transcriptionally repressing the retinoblastoma gene (Rb), previously shown to be required for the development of mature erythrocytes from progenitor cells, and instead promotes proliferation of these cells (PMID: 10330185, 24320889). FLI1 is most commonly altered in Ewing sarcoma, where the EWSR1-FLI1 gene fusion is the most common chromosomal alteration leading to aberrant FLI1 expression, transcriptional activity and cell transformation in this tumor type (PMID: 8246959, 7517940, 25453903, 10197607).	false

FLT1 (also VEGFRA) is a cell surface receptor that is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. Binding of the VEGF ligand, VEGFA, to FLT1 activates pathway signaling, which in turn regulates angiogenesis, cell survival, migration and invasion (PMID: 20127948). In addition, the VEGFA-FLT1 complex has been shown to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K/AKT signaling, and thus aberrant activation promotes tumor survival (PMID: 16116481, 20127948). FLT1 has also been shown to rescue tumor cells from hypoxia-induced stress (PMID: 16103078) and to regulate inflammatory response genes in macrophages associated with metastases (PMID: 26261265). Somatic mutations in FLT1 have been identified in a variety of tumor types, however, the impact of these alterations are not well-studied (PMID: 19718025, CBioPortal, MSKCC, March 2018). FLT1 overexpression and activation have been associated with increased transformation and invasion in colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer models (PMID: 14521839, 16397214, 16671089).

FLT3 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that predominantly functions in the regulation of hematopoiesis (PMID: 12032772). FLT3 is activated following dimerization and autophosphorylation upon binding to its ligand, FLT3L. Activation of FLT3 results in downstream signaling via several pathways including the MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STAT3/5 pathways, which have key roles in hematopoietic proliferation, differentiation and survival (PMID: 23631653, 12951584). Wildtype FLT3 is important for the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and is commonly expressed on immature myeloid and lymphoid cells (PMID: 12951584). FLT3 alterations occur in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), most commonly presenting as FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) in about 25% of AMLs or point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain in about 7% of AMLs (PMID: 24319184). FLT3-ITD expression in murine models is not sufficient to cause leukemogenesis, however, additional oncogenic alterations cooperate with overactivation of FLT3 to cause malignancy (PMID: 25873173). FLT3 small molecule kinase inhibitors have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials, both alone and in combination with other epigenetic inhibitors (PMID: 24682858, 28193779).	false

FLT4 (also VEGFR3) is a cell surface receptor that is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. Binding of the VEGF ligands, VEGF-C or VEGF-D, to FLT4 activates pathway signaling, which in turn mediates cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy in leukemia (PMID: 11877295, 16530705). In addition, FLT4 is a critical regulator of lymphangiogenesis and is necessary for the maintenance of the lymphatic endothelium (PMID: 10762646). Germline mutations in FLT4 have been identified in hereditary Nonne-Milroy disease, an autosomal dominant form of primary lymphedema type IA (PMID: 11292664). Aberrant FLT4 expression has been observed in several tumor types including lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 12875690) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (PMID: 12168824), among others, and has been shown to be hypermethylated in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (PMID: 28754676).

FOLH1, also known as PSMA, encodes for a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the M28 peptidase family (PMID: 29025989). FOLH1 functions as a glutamate carboxypeptidase and catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of glutamates from peptides and small molecules (PMID: 15837926). The enzymatic activity of FOLH1 has been utilized for the design of FOLH1-selective substrate drugs, such as methotrexate, in which the inactive glutamate form of the drug is cleaved and activated only in tissue expressing FOLH1 (PMID: 15837926, 33499427, 33782486). Overexpression of FOLH1 in various cancer cell lines induces cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that FOLH1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 33748101, 24571890).

FOXA1 is a member of the Forkhead domain containing (FKHD) family of transcription factors (PMID: 19274050). FOXA1 binds to genomic DNA via the N-terminus of the protein and interacts with histone molecules via the C-terminal transactivating domain. Binding of FOXA1 to core histones H3/H4 facilitates the âpioneering activityâ of FOXA1 by opening regions of condensed chromatin (PMID: 16909212); this allows for the recruitment of other transcription factors, including the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) (PMID: 21934649). FOXA1 is normally expressed in a number of tissue types, including lung, liver, pancreas, colon, bladder, prostate and breast (PMID: 22115363). Expression of FOXA1 is required for normal prostate development and maturation, prostate specific gene expression and cellular differentiation through its direct interaction with AR and modulation of AR signaling (PMID: 15987773, 21934649, 22649425, 18358809). Luminal-specific deletion of FOXA1 in the mouse prostate results in high rates of epithelial cell proliferation and increased expression of basal cell markers (PMID: 24840332), indicating that FOXA1 may play a role in promoting and maintaining epithelial cell differentiation. FOXA1 is also required for normal mammary ductal morphogenesis and expression of ERÎ± (PMID: 20501593). FOXA1 has emerged as one of the most frequent recurrently mutated genes in hormone-dependent cancers including primary and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and breast cancer (PMID: 25470049, 23000897,22495314). FOXA1 is also frequently mutated in urothelial bladder carcinoma and amplified in a number of other tumor types (PMID: 24476821).

In addition, FOXF1 has been implicated in a variety of cellular activities including ciliogenesis, cellular proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metastasis (PMID: 30950350, 28623323). Sporadic and familial mutations in FOXF1 have been implicated in alveolar capillary dysplasia with misaligned pulmonary veins (ACDMPV), a congenital disease that results in respiratory failure (PMID: 31199666, 31074124, 30380203,27071622, 23505205). These FOXF1 alterations are loss-of-function and lead to loss of STAT3-FOXF1 protein interactions and reduced chromatin binding (PMID: 31199666). FOXF1 activity has been found to be both increased and decreased in a variety of cancers, suggesting that FOXF1 may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the cellular context (PMID: 27165781, 30253191, 30189360, 28623323, 27042124). In Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), FOXF1 regulates the expression of two genes, KIT and ETV1, by recruiting them to relevant target genes (PMID: 29162563). Loss of FOXF1 results in reduced GIST cellular proliferation and loss of KIT and ETV1 targeting to enhancers in GIST cells (PMID: 29162563).	true

FOXL2 contains a DNA binding domain allowing the protein to bind DNA and subsequently regulate gene expression and mediate the recruitment of other transcription factors (PMID: 15492844). Expression of FOXL2 is the highest in ovarian granulosa cells and is essential for granulosa cell differentiation and ovarian development; FOXL2 is also expressed in the pituitary gland and periocular region (PMID: 24817949). Through interaction with other transcription factors and tumor suppressors, FOXL2 regulates several cell processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle progression and cell adhesion (PMID: 19747961). In addition, FOXL2 has a role in the suppression of SOX9 expression during testes formation (PMID: 28193729). As a potential tumor suppressor, FOXL2 has been shown to inhibit cervical squamous cancer cell proliferation and invasion, while promoting apoptosis (PMID: 24817949). Reduced expression of FOXL2 has also been noted in a majority of juvenile ovarian granulosa cell tumors and somatic FOXL2 alterations have been associated with adult granulosa cell tumors.

FOXN4 modulates NOTCH signaling through interaction with transcription factor ASCL1 to mediate BMP/TGFÎ² signaling (PMID: 24257627). FOXN4 is considered a candidate prognostic biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 33447073). Overexpression of FOXN4 in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines induces downregulation of EGFR expression, a commonly observed phenotype in transformed small-cell lung cancer (PMID: 34155000).

FOXO1 plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenesis and differentiation of preadipocytes by binding to the promoter of PPARG, a key mediator of adipogenesis initiation (PMID: 12530968). In addition, FOXO1 is critical for regulating gluconeogenesis via insulin signaling (PMID: 10702299) and for maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (PMID: 24116102). FOXO1 activity is repressed after phosphorylation by AKT, leading to exclusion of FOXO1 from the nucleus and, in some contexts, apoptosis (PMID: 17646672). CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 is also important for the regulation of cell cycle progression (PMID:17038621). Chromosomal FOXO1 translocations have been identified in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a skeletal-muscle tumor that is prevalent in children (PMID: 17646672, 8275086).

FOXO3 functions at the G2/M-phase in the cell cycle progression as an activator of the DNA-damage repair response through interaction with growth arrest protein GADD45A (PMID: 11964479). The cellular proliferative signaling pathways controlled by FOXO3 are negatively regulated by various signaling pathways, including PI3K and ERK, in response to external stimuli (PMID: 18601916, 18204439). Overexpression of FOXO3 in breast cancer models and endothelial progenitor cells suppresses cellular proliferation, suggesting that FOXO3 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 18312651, 15084260, 25093499). Downregulation of FOXO3 has been identified in various types of cancer, including glioma and ovarian cancer (PMID: 19911116, 19160093).

The oncogenic role of FSTL1 is likely tissue type specific. Overexpression of FSTL1 in glioma and gastric cancer cell lines induces increased cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that FSTL1 predominantly functions as an oncogene in these tissues (PMID: 29212066, 33791149). Amplification of FSTL1 has been identified in various different cancer types, including glioblastoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and prostate cancer (PMID: 18483363, 28883005, 27976415). Conversely, ectopic expression of FSTL1 in ovarian cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines suppresses cellular proliferation, migration and invasion (PMID: 18796737, 26918942).

The protein FUBP1, binds single-stranded DNA, including regulatory DNA elements upstream of genes. Among the motifs it binds is the far upstream element (FUSE), which is located upstream of the MYC oncogene (PMID: 22926519). Regulation of MYC by FUBP1 is complex; while overexpression of FUBP1 can activate transcription of the MYC gene, it has also been reported that inactivating mutations of FUBP1 activate MYC expression (PMID: 20420426). FUBP1 is also known to bind RNA (PMID: 23818605), such as in order to regulate the splicing of MDM2, an important negative regulator of the tumor suppressor TP53 (PMID: 24798327). FUBP1 was reported to be mutated at relatively low frequency (<8%) across a variety of cancers (cBioPortal, Nov 3, 2015).

FURIN functions as a serine endonuclease that cleaves proteins at basic amino acid sequences in order to convert a preprocessed protein to an activated state (PMID: 12360192). Many FURIN substrates have been identified including precursors for TGF-Î², NOTCH1, hormones, metalloproteinases, and cytokines, among others (PMID: 16627761, 12360192, 28821477). In addition, FURIN is required for the proteolytic processing of viral glycoproteins including the proteins that compose the HIV and influenza viral envelopes (PMID: 10707087, 10087614). FURIN is localized to the Golgi and is ubiquitously expressed, but its upregulation during T cell activation plays a key role in STAT transcription factor signaling and peripheral tolerance (PMID: 18701887, 16627761). Because FURIN regulates the processing of a variety of proteins, FURIN is implicated in many cellular functions including signaling, cell proliferation and metastasis (PMID: 18064302). Somatic mutations in FURIN are rare; however, overexpression of FURIN has been identified in several tumor types, including head and neck cancers (PMID: 28369813).

FZR1 activates APC/C through recognition of the KEN box consensus motif, allowing binding during the late meiotic phase until G1/S transition (PMID: 25349192). Functional studies using human-derived cell lines demonstrated FZR1 plays a regulatory role in DNA repair through the downregulation of CtIP, a DNA end resection factor protein, in late G2/S phase of the cell cycle (PMID: 25349192). The tumor suppressive role of FZR1 has been demonstrated through in vitro functional assays in human-derived cell lines as measured by FZR1 negatively regulating BRAF oncogenic function through proteolysis and dimerization disruption (PMID: 28174173). Loss of function FZR1 mutations have been identified in colorectal cancer, melanoma and glioma (PMID: 18535175, 28174173, 18662541). Conversely, human-derived xenograft models of colorectal cancer demonstrated an oncogenic role for FZR1 as measured by oncogenic phosphatase PRL-3-mediated aberrant activation of FZR1, promoting tumor growth (PMID: 30498084). In vitro studies with knocked down FZR1 in multiple myeloma cell lines also demonstrated tumor growth arrest (PMID: 27655696). Amplification of FZR1 has been identified in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma (PMID: 28143883, 27655696). Rearrangement of FZR1 has been identified in breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 25500544).	true

GAB1 is an adaptor protein that is a member of the IRS1-like docking protein family (PMID: 19737390). GAB1 functions as a signaling effector molecule that localizes to the plasma membrane via interactions with the phospholipid PIP3, resulting in phosphorylation-dependent activity in response to growth factor or cytokine stimulation (PMID: 25460044). The association of GAB1 with adaptor molecules (such as GRB2) and with receptor tyrosine kinases (such as MET and EGFR) is required for the activation of downstream signaling cascades (PMID: 9356464, 9444958, 9658397). In addition, GAB1 mediates the activity and recruitment of intracellular kinases such as PI3K and the MAPK pathway (PMID: 9632795). Sophisticated positive and negative feedback mechanisms control the binding of GAB1 to signaling complexes, which can lead to alternate downstream signaling pathway activation (PMID: 18025104). The activity of GAB1 is important for a variety of cellular functions including the regulation of proliferation, migration, and survival (PMID: 19737390). Rare somatic mutations in GAB1 are found in breast cancers, resulting in increased cytokine-independent oncogenic signaling (PMID: 22751113, 16959974). Overexpression of GAB1 has been identified in several cancer types and aberrant GAB1 activity is associated with resistance mechanisms in BRAF-mutant melanomas due to altered feedback regulation of MET signaling (PMID: 28147313, 17463250, 17312329).	false

Sophisticated positive and negative feedback mechanisms control the binding of GAB2 to signaling complexes, which can lead to alternate downstream signaling pathway activation (PMID: 28096188). The activity of GAB2 is important for a variety of cellular functions including the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, migration and survival (PMID: 19737390). Expression of GAB2 in murine models has been associated with the proliferation of breast cancer cells and promotion of metastasis (PMID: 17310989, 16369543). Amplification and overexpression of GAB2 have been identified in several cancer types, including ovarian and breast cancers, among others (PMID: 18314909, 19509136, 19881546, 23362323, 24385586).	false

GATA1 is a transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of hematopoietic differentiation (PMID: 1987478). GATA1 activates the expression of many important genes involved in erythroid and megakaryocyte development (PMID:7568185, 7823932), including the beta-globin gene and erythropoietin receptor (PMID:1924329, 1660143). Appropriate expression of GATA1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells is critical for the maturation of red blood cells, megakaryocytes, mast cells and eosinophils (PMID: 15659348). Loss of GATA1 expression in murine models suppresses the production of red blood cells (PMID: 8901585), highlighting the importance of GATA1 expression in erythroid development. Germline mutations in GATA1 are associated with anemia, thrombocytopenia and porphyria (PMID: 10700180, 11675338, 16783379, 17148589). Inherited GATA1 mutations have been implicated in Diamond Blackfan anemia due to the reduced translation of GATA1 protein (PMID: 24952648). GATA1 mutations observed in Down Syndrome patients are associated with acute megakaryocytic leukemia development and transient myeloid disorders (PMID: 12172547, 12747884). Reduced expression of GATA1 corresponds with the development of hematopoietic malignancies due to inadequate production of erythroid cell types (PMID: 12149188). Recurrent GATA1 rearrangements are found in patients with acute basophilic leukemia (PMID: 21474671).	false

Germline mutations of GATA2 are associated with Emberger and MonoMAC syndromes and predispose to leukemias.	GATA2 is a transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of hematopoietic differentiation. GATA2 activates the expression of many important genes involved in hematopoiesis, including those involved in stem cell maintenance and cell specification (PMID:8078582, 12433372, 25578878, 20887958). In addition, GATA2 has been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (PMID:23892628). Appropriate expression of GATA2 is required in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to initiate hematopoietic lineage specification (PMID: 28179280). Importantly, GATA2 regulates the activation of GATA1, a process termed the âGATA switchâ, which then ultimately results in the repression of GATA2 (PMID: 12857954). Loss of GATA2 expression in murine models results in the suppression of definitive hematopoiesis, highlighting the importance of GATA2 in hematopoietic regulation (PMID: 8078582). Germline GATA2 mutations are associated with familial myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 21892162) and Emberger syndrome, a heritable lymphedema disorder associated with a predisposition to AML (PMID: 21892158). Inherited GATA2 mutations are also found in patients with MonoMAC syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder leading to vulnerability to select infectious agents (PMID: 21670465). Somatic GATA2 mutations are found in leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes and often co-occur with CEBPA mutations (PMID: 23634996, 22649106, 23521373,18250304). GATA2-EV1 translocations have been identified in patients with inversion 3 leukemias (PMID:24703711).

GATA3 is a DNA binding protein that controls the development of diverse tissues by activating or repressing transcription of genes important in cell proliferation and differentiation (PMID: 21779441, 19798694). GATA3 regulation has cell-type specific effects on gene expression and is expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues (PMID: 12923059, 17129787, 19112489). Haploinsufficiency of GATA3 results in the autosomal dominant HDR (hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renaldysplasia) syndrome, also known as Barakat syndrome (PMID: 10935639). GATA3 expression is essential in the development of normal mammary epithelium in mice and humans and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of luminal breast cancer (reviewed in PMID: 21779441, 19798694). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function GATA3 mutations have been identified in breast cancer, suggesting that in different contexts GATA3 may function as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor (PMID: 27588951).	true

GLI1 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an important role in normal neural development and function via regulation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway (PMID: 9634234,9584120). The GLI1 transcription factor binds DNA directly to activate Shh target genes in response to pathway activation and can function as both a transcription activator and transcription repressor depending on the signaling context (PMID: 10375510). In the absence of Shh ligand, GLI1 is cleaved by proteases to produce a truncated protein lacking C-terminal amino acids necessary for transcription activation (PMID: 9215627). Following Shh ligand exposure, GLI1 is no longer cleaved and can activate transcription of Shh target genes. GLI1 is an oncogene and is typically mutated or overexpressed in glioblastomas, where it can cause aberrant activation of the Shh-Gli signaling pathway (PMID: 12044012).	false

GNA11 is an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) (PMID: 23640210, 28223438). G proteins, composed of Î±, Î², and Î³ subunits, are intracellular signaling proteins that initiate signaling cascades following activation by membrane-spanning G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)  (PMID: 23640210). Following activation by a GPCR, GDP-bound GNA11 (a GÎ±q protein) exchanges GDP for GTP and activates downstream signaling via binding to phospholipase C Î² (PLCB4), (PMID: 27089179, 28223438). PLCB4 activates PIP2 cleavage, resulting in activation of the second messenger proteins diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) to prompt calcium release (PMID: 27089179). GNA11-mediated signaling promotes the activation of a variety of downstream pathways, including PKC, MAPK, and PI3K signaling, which mediate several cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (PMID: 27089179, 23177739). GNA11 alterations inhibit the GTPase hydrolysis activity of the protein, thereby causing GNA11 to remain bound to GTP in a constitutively activated state (PMID: 24077403, 21083380). Somatic mutations in GNA11 are found in patients with uveal melanoma, and more rarely, cutaneous melanoma (PMID: 24077403, 21083380). Alterations in GNA11 are mutually exclusive with the G-protein GNAQ in uveal melanoma (PMID: 24713608). Therapeutic strategies targeting the activation of MAPK signaling pathways may be efficacious in patients with GNA11 mutations (PMID: 29206651, 22733540) due to amplification of the GPCR-independent signaling (PMID: 29738114, 28223438).	false

When bound to GDP, the GNA12 alpha subunit, along with the beta and gamma subunits, form an inhibitory complex; subsequently, activated G protein-coupled receptor binding can initiate a conformation change in GNA12, resulting in the exchange of GDP for GTP and release of the beta/gamma subunits (PMID: 19226283). GTP-bound GNA12 now functions as an activated effector molecule mediating downstream signaling (PMID: 18814923, 19226283). GNA12 activates the small GTPase RhoA and RhoGEFs, which in turn mediate multiple signaling pathways that regulate migration, adhesion, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation (PMID: 26989201, 18814923). GNA12 binds several proteins including HSP90 (PMID: 24435554).

Several kinases are capable of regulating the protein kinase including p70 S6 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p90Rsk, protein kinases A, B and C, and MEK1/2 (PMID: 12615961, 11527574, 16935409, 11394906, 15020233). Dysregulated GSK3B has been implicated in the development of a number of human diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases and bipolar disorder (PMID: 12615961, 11527574, 16935409). Overexpression of the protein kinase has also been implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression including ovarian, colon, liver and pancreatic carcinomas (PMID: 16556076, 17912008, 11883528, 16556076, 16342409, 18606491). Several GSK3Î² inhibitors have been studied in preclinical trials, for example pharmacological inhibitors suppress proliferation of the ovarian cancer cells in vitro and prevents the formation of tumors in nude mice generated by the inoculation of human ovarian cancer cells (PMID: 16788573).	false

GTF2I (also TFII-I) is a general transcription factor that regulates the transcription of several signaling proteins (PMID: 22037610, 22037610). GTF2I mediates the expression of various genes important in cell cycle control, stress response, and genomic stability, including FOS, BRCA, and STAT proteins, among other others, in association with a variety of transcriptional complexes (PMID: 28657656, 24922507, 24231951, 21407215). GTF2I has also been implicated in heavy chain immunoglobulin transcription in immune cells and plays an important role in T-cell receptor signaling (PMID: 21549311, 11313464, 19701889). In addition, GTF2I can directly bind CTCF, a regulator of epigenetic state, to drive transcriptional initiation at target genes (PMID: 25646466). Germline deletions in GTF2I are found in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome, a multisystem developmental disorder (PMID: 10198167). Somatic GTF2I mutations have been identified in epithelial thymic tumors and follicular T cell-derived lymphomas (PMID: 24974848, 27369867). GTF2I mutations occur predominantly as missense mutations and are predicted to disrupt protein degradation of GTF2I, leading to increased protein expression (PMID: 24974848). These alterations tend to occur in more indolent thymic tumor subtypes and are associated with a better prognosis (PMID: 28676218).	false

H1 histone proteins bind to linker DNA between nucleosomes and influences higher order chromatin structure. The histone H1 family comprises eleven members, each one transcribed by its own gene. A number of studies have shown that H1 levels are altered in cancer and variant-specific changes can be observed in different tumor types. Although H1 variants share significant homology in their globular DNA-binding domain, they are more divergent in their C- and N-terminal tails, and evidence suggests that they may have distinct functions in the nucleus. The so-called âmainâ H1 variants, which include H1-1, H1-2, H1-3, H1-4, H1-5, H1-6, are mainly transcribed in S-phase and therefore expressed at high levels only in dividing cells (PMID: 18208346, 26474902, 26386351). H1-2 mutations have been identified in follicular lymphoma and impair H1-2 binding to DNA, likely impacting chromatin structure and gene expression (PMID: 24362818).	false

H1-3 is a histone H1 linker protein that encodes the non-canonical H1.3 histone variant (PMID: 9031620). Histone variants, such as H1.3, have sequences that differ from the canonical histone protein and appear to be interchangeable with the major protein form (PMID: 9031620). Histone proteins are an essential component of the nucleosome which consists of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones), and therefore allow for the effective packaging of DNA in the nucleus (PMID: 11498575). In addition to the core histone molecules, H1 linker histones mediate the stabilization of histone molecules and higher order chromatin state (PMID: 9031620). H1-3 expression is replication-dependent and H1-3 is most highly expressed in the thymus, lung, and spleen (PMID: 28794128). H1-3 is detected on chromatin throughout the cell cycle (PMID: 20104577), is depleted at active promoters and regulatory units (PMID: 21852237), suppresses RAD51/RAD54-mediated homologous pairing (PMID: 26757249) and directly mediates chromatin compaction (PMID: 19794910). H1-3 is also a member of an HDAC3 containing complex that mediates the repression of the retinoic acid receptor and the thyroid hormone receptor (PMID: 26663086). Somatic mutations in H1-3 are rare; however, overexpression of H1-3 has been associated with repression of the oncogenic factor H19 in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting it functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 28687618, 25205099).	true

In addition to the core histone molecules, H1 linker histones mediate the stabilization of histone molecules and higher order chromatin state (PMID: 9031620). H1-4 expression is replication-dependent and is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of cell types (PMID: 28794128). Expression of H1-4 is gender-specific and is enriched on the paternal inactive chromosome (PMID: 18927631). H1-4 mediates the binding of the repressive protein HP1Î± and is depleted from active regulatory regions of the chromatin (PMID: 30007360, 23746450). Loss of HISTH1E in breast cancer cells results in growth suppression, suggesting a role in cell survival (PMID: 18927631).

H1-5 expression is replication-dependent and H1-5 is most highly expressed in the thymus and spleen (PMID: 28794128). H1-5 binds chromatin in the embryonic germ layers and binding is progressively lost during epigenetic reprogramming (PMID: 28794128, 28794128). In differentiated cells, H1-5 regulates chromatin structure near genes that encode membrane or membrane-associated proteins (PMID: 22956909). H1-5 has been implicated in the repression of gene expression and a regulator of SIRT1 deacetylase activity (PMID: 22956909). Depletion of H1-5 results in loss of SIRT1 binding, loss of H3K9me2, increased chromatin accessibility and decreased cellular growth (PMID: 22956909). H1-5 has also been shown to bind FOXP3 in T regulatory cells at relevant target genes (PMID: 21654845). Rare somatic mutations in H1-5 have been identified in colon cancer and are predicted to maintain a more undifferentiated chromatin state (PMID: 16959974).

HDAC1 is a histone deacetylase that is termed a Class I HDAC, in a family with HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 (PMID: 27599530). Histone deacetylases remove the acetyl group from relevant lysine amino acids on either histone or non-histone cellular substrates, altering epigenetic state and gene transcription (PMID: 24691964). HDAC1 activity regulates several key cellular functions including apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage response, and metastasis (PMID: 22147512, 27599530). In addition, HDAC1 deacetylates tumor suppressors and oncogenes, including TP53, HIF-1Î±, MLL and NK-kB (PMID: 11931769, 12829790), impacting their activity. Knockdown of HDAC1 expression in preclinical models results in an anti-proliferative effect, leading to an induction in p21 and p27 and repression of several cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (PMID: 22496786). Somatic HDAC1 mutations are found in patients with liposarcoma (PMID: 22328974); however, alterations tend to be rare in human cancers. Increased expression of HDAC1 is associated with poor outcomes in several tumor types including gastric and ovarian cancers, among others (PMID: 25482492). A variety of HDAC inhibitors are FDA-approved for the treatment of several cancers including vorinostat (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), romidepsin (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), panobinostat (multiple myeloma), and belinostat (peripheral T cell lymphoma).

HDAC2 encodes for a histone deacetylase that functions in the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (PMID: 28497810). HDAC2 is a component of multiple corepressor complexes and functions in transcriptional repression of various genes involved in physiological cellular processes (PMID: 12724404, 12493763, 10888872). Overexpression of HDAC2 in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation, dysregulation of G1/S cell cycle progression and decreased apoptosis, suggesting that HDAC2 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 34365463, 23175521, 22492270). Amplification of HDAC2 has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and colon cancer (PMID: 28560068, 34903606, 24948597).

Histone deacetylases remove the acetyl group from relevant lysine amino acids on either histone or non-histone cellular substrates, altering epigenetic state and gene transcription (PMID: 24691964). HDAC4 activity regulates several key cellular functions including cell cycle, DNA damage response and angiogenesis (PMID: 12668657, 19071119). Expression of 53BP1, a DNA damage protein, co-localizes with HDAC4 and regulates the DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint (PMID: 12668657). Additionally, HDAC4 transcriptionally activates HIF-1Î± (PMID: 19071119). Somatic HDAC4 mutations are rare in human cancers; however, HDAC4 is predicted to function as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in different cellular contexts. Deletions in HDAC4 are found in patients with melanoma (PMID: 21571862) while overexpression of HDAC4 is associated with gastric and acute lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 25091122, 23948281).

Aberrant HGF expression with increased MET signaling has been described in various tumor types and results in increased cell survival, motility and metastasis.	HGF (hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor) is a multidomain protein that directly binds to the tyrosine kinase MET, which leads to its dimerization and activation (PMID: 3319692, 2531289). HGF is primarily expressed as pro-HGF and needs proteolytic activation to form HGF (PMID: 22270953, 1826653). MET activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of various effector proteins such as PLC, GAB1, GRB2 and SRC. HGF/MET signaling is physiolgically required for liver and skin regeneration as well as Epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) in embryogenesis. In cancer, HGF/MET signaling is involved in stemness, metastasis and angiogenesis (PMID: 22270953). Downstream effectors in the context of cancer involve the WNT-beta-catenin pathway, PI3K-AKT as well as TGFbeta signalling. A number of small molecule and antibody based MET receptor inhibitors have been developed and are tested in clinical trials with variable results.	false

HIF1A is a transcription factor subunit that mediates gene expression in hypoxic conditions (PMID: 13130303). HIF-1, a transcriptional activator that is stabilized in the absence of oxygen, is composed of HIF1A, an oxygen-regulated subunit, and HIF1B, a ubiquitously expressed subunit (PMID: 20965423). In normoxic conditions, the E3 ligase VHL ubiquitinates and targets HIF1A to the proteasome for degradation via binding coordinated by hydroxylation (PMID: 13130303). Normal oxygen levels also preclude the binding of the transcriptional activators p300 and CBP to HIF1A, inhibiting HIF1A-dependent transcriptional activation (PMID: 24421387). In hypoxic conditions, VHL can no longer bind HIF1A due to loss of hydroxylation, resulting in protein stabilization of HIF1A (PMID: 13130303). HIF1A regulates an extensive network of transcriptional activity during hypoxia including regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis, metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion, among others (PMID: 13130303, 28741521, 26955619). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a gene involved in angiogenesis, is the most well-established HIF1A transcriptional target; most other transcriptional changes are context dependent. Somatic mutations in HIF1A are rare in human cancers; however, overexpression of HIF1A is found in many tumor types. Intratumoral hypoxia is common in malignant tumors, and increased HIF1A expression has been identified in tumors that have mutations in relevant hypoxia-related genes such as VHL (PMID: 26955619, 24446253).	false

HIRA encodes for a histone chaperone that functions in nucleosome assembly with the H3.3 histone variant (PMID: 16251970). HIRA colocalizes with other histone-binding proteins such as UBN1, CABIN1 and ASF1a to form the HIRA chaperone complex and deposit histone H3.3 at its binding sites (PMID: 23602572). HIRA functions in the repression of histone gene transcription during the cell cycle to trigger a block of DNA synthesis (PMID: 12370293). Deficiency in HIRA in various types of cancer cell types and models induces cellular proliferation and invasion, suggesting that HIRA functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 36269833, 11238922, 25512559). Downregulation of HIRA has been identified in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 36269833).	true

HLA-A is a heavy chain subunit of the major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) complex. A critical component of the immune system is the presentation of foreign antigens on the cell surface by the MHC molecules (PMID: 10974135). Tumor cells are vulnerable to such an immune response due to the presentation of tumor-specific antigens, such as mutated oncoproteins, on the cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435). Several types of tumors are known to evade such an immunological response by crippling the levels of MHC I-presenting antigens on the tumor cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435, 11665717). The HLA-A genes encode for the heavy chain subunit of the MHC (PMID: 22434516). A reduction in HLA-A levels is seen in many tumors, which may be due to factors like genomic alteration, transcriptional regulation, protein transportation, and oncogene regulation (PMID: 24244023, 11665717). Genomic alterations are observed only rarely; chromosomal loss resulting in loss of the HLA locus is observed in 13.8% of colon tumors, 17.6% of laryngeal tumors, 15.3% of melanoma tumors and 17.2% of epithelial squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 9057360). In HCT116 colorectal cancer cells HLA-A1 and HLA-A2 are down regulated by DNA methylation and by the action of the MEK pathway (PMID: 19569244). Similarly, gastric and esophageal cancers also display HLA-A downregulation via action of RAS, MYC and the HER2 oncogene, as well as the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (PMID: 24244023, 20715101, 20628381).	true

A critical component of the immune system is the presentation of foreign antigens on the cell surface by the MHC molecules (PMID: 10974135, 15719024). Immune recognition leads to the stimulation of a signaling cascade that results in apoptosis of MHC-presenting target cells (PMID: 15719024). Tumor cells are vulnerable to such an immune response due to the presentation of tumor-specific antigens such as mutated oncoproteins on the cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435). HLA-B is anchored in the membrane of most cells, and it has a highly polymorphic region that facilitates a wide binding specificity for a variety of antigens that need to be presented to cytotoxic immune T cells (PMID: 25493333). Germline polymorphisms and haplotypes in HLA-B have been linked with various autoimmune syndromes and hypersensitivity to certain medications (PMID: 22188278, 25877443).	true

HLA-C is a heavy chain subunit of the major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) complex. HLA-C is one of the three MHC I surface receptors that function as a heterodimer in collaboration with Î²-microglobulin to regulate immune responses (PMID: 15719024). A critical component of the immune system is the presentation of foreign antigens on the cell surface by the MHC molecules (PMID: 10974135, 15719024). Immune recognition leads to the stimulation of a signaling cascade that results in apoptosis of MHC-presenting target cells (PMID: 15719024). Tumor cells are vulnerable to such an immune response due to the presentation of tumor-specific antigens such as mutated oncoproteins on the cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435). HLA-C molecules are highly polymorphic and the breadth of these repertoires can predispose to autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis (PMID: 28855257, 16642438). Several types of tumors are known to evade an immunological response by downregulating the levels of MHC I-presenting antigens on the tumor cell surface (PMID: 24782321, 24244023, 23157435, 11665717). A reduction in HLA-C levels in cancer could occur due to many factors including mutation, transcriptional downregulation, epigenetic silencing and protein stability, among others (PMID: 26796069, 26372948, 31564637). HLA-C downregulation may result in reduced efficacy of immunotherapy in patients whose cancers display an evasion of the immune system (PMID: 9057360, 24782321, 23157435, 26796069).	true

HMGA2, or HMGI-C, encodes a chromatin remodeling protein that binds to DNA through AT-hook DNA binding domains, allowing recruitment of transcription factor and histone modification proteins to remodel chromatin and modulate gene expression (PMID: 1692833, 3456586). HMGA2 regulates the transcriptional activity of genes, such as cyclin A and ERCC1, through binding to specific AT-rich sites at the gene promoter region (PMID: 14645522, 14627817). HMGA2 expression is upregulated widely in undifferentiated cells during embryogenesis, and eventually expression is downregulated or absent in tissues over the course of fetal development and into adulthood (PMID: 7651535). Overexpression of HMGA2 in cancer cell lines and mice results in tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting that HMGA2 predominantly functions as an oncogene (PMID: 25014774, 10945639). HMGA2 amplification has been identified in various cancer types, including esophageal squamous carcinoma, colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer (PMID: 27027341, 21252160, 17600087).

Germline mutations of HNF1A are associated with Maturity Onset Diabetes of Young (MODY3) and hepatic adenomas familial (HEPAF), while somatic inactivating mutations are found in a diverse range of cancers.	HNF1A is a liver-specific transcription factor that is a member of the hepatocyte nuclear factor protein family. HNF1A, together with other hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF4A, HNF6) forms tissue-specific regulatory circuits and acts as master regulators of liver and pancreatic islet transcription (PMID:14988562). HNF1A-/- mice showed defects in hepatic function, renal Fanconi syndrome, type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 11279518). Heterozygous germline mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of Young or MODY3 (PMID: 8945470). Bi-allelic somatic inactivating mutations and deletions in HNF1A are seen in about 40-50% of hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) (PMID: 12355088). Two HNF1A mutations, W206 (DNA binding domain) and P291 (Trans-activation domain), have been found over represented across different studies (PMID: 16496320, 20393147, 12355088). Among them, W206 is unique to HCA while P291 is common to both HCA and MODY. In rare cases of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), HNF1A mutations were seen in combination with other genetic alterations (PMID: 12355088).	true

HNF1B, a member of the homeobox-containing basic helix-turn-helix family, encodes for a DNA-binding transcription factor that forms a homodimer or heterodimer with HNF1A (PMID: 1763325, 7900999). HNF1B regulates various cellular processes, such as cellular differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy, through the repression and activation of target genes (PMID: 28622294, 25715395). Alterations of HNF1B are found in a large percentage of dominant inherited nephropathy (PMID: 33305128, 21775974). The oncogenic function of HNF1B is likely tissue-specific. Ectopic expression of HNF1B in prostate cancer and serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines suppresses cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that HNF1B functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in this tissue context (PMID: 31636385, 33174391, 24105991). Downregulation of HNF1B has been identified in renal cancer, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, kidney chromophobe and lung squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 15168014, 28807937, 33173410). Conversely, upregulation of HNF1B has been identified in bladder urothelial carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (PMID: 33173410).	false

Germline mutations of HOXB13 predispose to certain cancers, including prostate cancer.	HOXB13 is a member of the homeobox (HOX) gene family, which is a group of clustered transcription factors that are evolutionarily conserved and crucial for embryonic development along the anterior-posterior axis (PMID: 1346368). In addition to regulating body axis patterning in embryos, HOXB13 has roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and cell cycle activity (PMID: 28798948). HOXB13 mediates gene expression in a cell-type specific manner due to variation in interactions with adaptor molecules. HOXB13 has been implicated in prostate cell identity, and mice lacking HOXB13 have prostate defects (PMID: 12668621). HOXB13 functions through the androgen receptor (AR) in both normal adult tissue and prostate cancer by regulating the chromatin state around the AR gene, and can have both growth-enhancing or growth-suppressing effects depending on context (PMID: 15604291, 19917249). Germline HOXB13 mutations have been found in familial prostate cancer and are predictive of prostate cancer risk (PMID: 22236224), while somatic HOXB13 mutations have been identified in several other cancer types (PMID: 28798948). Though HOXB13 is overexpressed during malignant progression of prostate and breast cancer (PMID: 20018680), it is downregulated in colorectal and renal cell cancer models, suggesting that it has context-specific effects in human tumors (PMID: 15928669, 16278676, 15193263, 17453342, 23832664).	true

HRAS (Harvey Ras) is a membrane-associated GTPase. It plays an important role as an upstream mediator of several pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3 kinase (PI3K) pathways. HRAS, NRAS and KRAS comprise the Ras proto-oncogene family, and all three have a similar structure and function. Transforming, gain-of-function mutations of RAS oncogenes tend to disrupt GTPase activity and promote cell proliferation and angiogenesis (PMID: 12778136). Overexpression of oncogenic HRAS also triggers growth factor-independent cell cycle progression and upregulation of proteins implicated in tumor growth (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9). HRAS mutations are found most commonly in cancers of the thyroid, salivary glands, bladder urinary tract, cervix and prostate (PMID: 21993244, 22589270). Patients with Costello syndrome, a hereditary disorder with germline alterations in HRAS, can develop various malignancies at a young age, including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (PMID: 22261753, 16170316). RAS mutations (including HRAS) have been found in a significant proportion of RET negative medullary thyroid cancer (PMID: 21325462, 23240926, 22865907, 23264394). And while multikinase inhibitors that include HRAS among its targets are FDA-approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, the FDA-approval is not based on the HRAS mutant status, therefore not explicitly meeting the OncoKB Level 1 criteria.	false

The anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic function of HSD17B2 maintains cell cycle homeostasis through negative regulation of hormone-induced proliferation and differentiation in endometrial tissue (PMID: 18270252). Overexpression of HSD17B2 in prostate cancer cell lines suppresses cell proliferation and xenograft growth, suggesting that HSD17B2 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 30228209).

HSP90AA1, a member of the HSP90 family of heat shock proteins, encodes for a molecular chaperone which functions in maintaining cellular homeostasis and cell cycle control through ATPase activity (PMID: 11812147, 11274138). HSP90AA1 recruits ATP and co-chaperones to substrate proteins, referred to as client proteins, and facilitates assembly, folding and degradation (PMID: 34380015). The numerous client proteins of HSP90AA1 typically include steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases, such as PIM1, AKT and HIF1A (PMID: 10544245, 3900074, 30536958). Knockdown of HSP90AA1 in various cancer cell lines and models suppresses cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis, suggesting that HSP90AA1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 35095481, 30153855). Upregulation of HSP90AA1 has been identified in various cancers, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 31687275, 34109171, 30521791).

HTATIP2, also known as TIP30 or CC3, encodes an oxidoreductase that functions in nuclear transport inhibition through importin binding and transcription regulation (PMID: 15728189). HTATIP2 functions in the stimulation of TAT-mediated transcription, upregulating apoptosis and tumor suppression through transcription promotion of apoptosis-related genes Bad and Siva and tumor suppressor gene NM23-H2 (PMID: 10698937). TAT-mediated transcription enhancement occurs through HTATIP2 phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit in a TAT-dependent manner (PMID: 10698937). Overexpression of HTATIP2 in cancer cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation, reduced tumor metastasis and increased apoptosis, suggesting that HTATIP2 predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 30249892, 25617528, 25544767). Loss of HTATIP2 has been identified in various cancer types, including glioma, lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 25617528, 32545251,19010857). Epigenetic silencing of HTATIP2 through hypermethylation is a mechanism identified in various cancer cells that results in HTATIP2 downregulation and is associated with poor patient prognosis (PMID: 25617528, 19010857).	true

ID1 encodes for a DNA-binding inhibitor protein that interacts with the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors to regulate their activity (PMID: 2156629). As ID1 has no DNA binding activity of its own, interactions with the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors result in the inhibition of DNA binding and transcriptional activity through the formation of nonfunctional heterodimeric complexes (PMID: 2156629). ID1 has been implicated in the promotion of cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell cycle proliferation through the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (PMID: 25924227). Overexpression of ID1 in various cancer cell lines and mouse models has demonstrated increased metastatic ability and cellular proliferation, suggesting that ID1 functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 32705157, 24160469, 25938540).

ID3 (Inhibitor for DNA binding 3) is a protein that binds basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors and inhibits their activity. ID3 proteins form heterodimers with tissue-specific HLH proteins, such as E proteins, that disrupt their binding to DNA (PMID: 2000388, 2156629, 16034366). ID3 can regulate cell differentiation, cell proliferation, cell invasiveness and angiogenesis (PMID: 8197168, 11840325, 11840326, 10197587, 11058077, 9528806, 16034366). Loss of ID3 expression in mice results in defects in B-cell proliferation and the development of lymphomas (PMID: 10454544). Loss-of-function mutations in ID3 are common in Burkitt's lymphoma and result in disruption of ID3 transcriptional activity (PMID: 23143595).

The IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) protein is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±-KG), a crucial step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. IDH1 utilizes NADP(+) as an electron acceptor and it is predominantly expressed in the cytosol and peroxisomes, playing a role in the cytoplasmic production of NADPH. Cancer-associated mutations in the catalytic site of IDH1 confer a gain-of-function of neomorphic enzymatic activity, allowing the mutant enzyme to convert Î±-KG to the âoncometaboliteâ D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (PMID: 20171147). 2-HG promotes tumor development by inhibiting a variety of enzymes that require Î±-KG as a substrate, including enzymes involved in DNA demethylation, histone demethylation, adaptation to hypoxia and collagen maturation. IDH1 mutations have been identified in glioma, cholangiocarcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) among others (PMID: 19657110, 23630074) and may contribute to the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to bone marrow failure or AML (PMID: 29355841).	false

IFNAR1 encodes the protein interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 1, which, along with the IFNAR2 subunit, composes the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) (PMID:33552080, 24362405). Binding of type I interferons to the receptor activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway resulting in transcriptional activation or repression of interferon-regulated genes. IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 form a heterodimer complex and are associated with tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and JAK1, respectively, which are required for STAT recruitment to the receptor complex. STAT proteins are phosphorylated by the JAKs, which promote their translocation to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (PMID: 24362405, 22410872, 33552080, 32378445, 30555157). IFNAR is widely expressed in lymphocytes, natural killer cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMID: 36063748). The protein encoded by INFAR1 also functions as an antiviral factor (PMID: 24362405, 30555157). Inhibition of IFNAR1 signaling in natural killer cells has been demonstrated to promote virus clearance (PMID: 33771858). Elevated levels of IFNAR1 have been associated with poor prognosis in breast and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, while in colorectal cancer elevated levels are positively associated with T-cell infiltration and better response to chemotherapy (PMID: 36063748, 30555157, 32378445).

IFNGR1 is a high-affinity subunit of the interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) receptor, which is required by macrophages for killing intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria. After binding to interferon-Î³, two IFNGR1 molecules form a heterodimeric complex with two IFNGR2 molecules, which initiates interferon signaling. IFNGR1 binds JAK1, and stimulation of the interferon response results in downstream activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 22410872). Three cases of malignancy have been reported in patients with complete IFNGR1 deficiency: human herpesvirus-8 associated Kaposi sarcoma (PMID:15069403), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) related B-cell lymphoma (PMID: 23800860) and pineal germinoma, an intracranial tumor (PMID: 25216720). Mutations in IFNGR1 can result in enhanced susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, and low expression of IFNGR1 leads to a functional blockade of IFN-Î³ signaling (PMID:15589309). Somatic mutations in IFNGR1 have not yet been identified in human cancers, however, IFNGR1 expression is reduced in some breast cancers (PMID:22182699) and downregulated in a subset of metastatic prostate cancers (PMID:24953652).

IGF1 is an insulin-like growth factor that signals through the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and the insulin receptor (IR). The main function of IGF1 is to stimulate growth in a wide array of tissues. IGF1 is broadly expressed however the liver produces the majority of circulating IGF1 in response to GH secreted by the pituitary. Circulating IGF1 is bound to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), e.g. IGFBP3, and only the free IGF1 is biologically active. In epidemiologic studies, high circulating levels of IGF1 and low levels of IGFBP3 have been associated with breast, prostate, colon, lung, and genitourinary cancers (PMID: 9593409, 9365156, 9438850, 10203281, 9923856). Genetic variation in the 3-prime region of the IGF1 gene may contribute to increased circulating IGF1 levels (PubMed: 17911177).

IGF1R is an insulin-like growth factor receptor (PMID: 19029956), a tyrosine kinase which activates downstream pathways involved in growth and cell survival. IGF1R binds several ligands, including high affinity ligands (insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1)) and low-affinity ligands (insulin, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2)) (PMID: 12360255, 19029956, 22337149). Binding to ligands activates two oncogenic pathways, the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway and the RAS-MAPK pathway (PMID: 25984556). Missense mutations of IGF1R are observed across the entire gene body, and several of these mutations have been linked to changes in the basal activity of IGF1R (PMID: 22778948). IGF1R is over-expressed in several cancers, and its over-expression in cell lines can induce transformation (PMID: 9196021). IGF1R is frequently mutated/amplified across a variety of cancer types (frequency ~8%) (cBioPortal, Nov 2015, PMID: 25984556). Binding of ligand to IGF1R has been reported to mediate both resistance and sensitivity to both targeted and cytotoxic therapy across a number of cancer types (PMID: 25984556, 22337149). Various therapeutics have been developed to target IGF1R, either as monoclonal antibodies against IGF1R or IGF1R ligands, or as inhibitors of the kinase activity of IGF1R, but these therapeutics have shown limited success in large clinical trials (PMID: 23601239, 24338270 ).	false

Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and predisposes to several pediatric cancers.	IGF2 is an insulin growth factor which binds to receptor tyrosine kinases to activate downstream mitogenic signaling pathways (PMID: 24080445, 25704323). IGF2 binds to one of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including IGF1R and IR-A, to initiate a cascade that activates mitogenic and metabolic signaling via the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways (PMID: 24080445). In most adult tissues IGF2 is imprinted, and thus its expression is restricted to the paternal allele only (PMID: 12637750). Aberrant IGF2 expression, in many cases due to loss of imprinting, is implicated in the development of several tumor types (e.g. breast, ovarian, and Wilms tumors) (PMID: 17686827, 24080445), as well as the progression of tumors to more aggressive disease (e.g. breast cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia) (PMID: 20089431, 9558368, 24080445). Loss-of-imprinting of IGF2 is causative for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which confers an increased risk of developing childhood tumors such as Wilmsâ tumor and hepatoblastoma (PMID: 8968759, 12668598, 23620526).

Inhibitor of Kappa Light Polypeptide Gene Enhancer in B-Cell, Kinase Epsilon (IKBKE) is a serine/threonine kinase that has important functions in the regulation of inflammatory responses to infection as well as cancer (PMID: 23333767, 19160540). It is activated in cells that are infected with virus and as a result associates with DDX3X and phophorylates its target protein such as interferon regulatory factors (IRF3, IRF7) (PMID: 23333767, 19160540). As a result of their phosphorylation IRFs translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes such as IFNB. IKBKE also phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B leading to their degredation and further enhancing pro-inflammatory responses (PMID: 23333767, 19160540). It is overexpressed in >30% of primary breast cancer and amplifications affecting IKBKE locus have been observed (PMID: 23333767, 21042276, 17574021). IKBKE has been shown to exhibit oncogenic functions through the phosphorylation of CYLD at serine 418 and TRAF2 at serine 11(PMID: 19481526, 23007157). Additionally IKBKE also phosphorylates NF-kappa-B and AKT1 leading to higher NF-kappa-B activity (PMID: 21908616, 21464307). IKBKE has also been implicated in several other tumor entities (PMID:22942254, 19497997, 20001340, 21271611, 22266464). Recently, IKBKE inhibitors have been developed and are currently tested pre-clinically (PMID: 22305584, 23099093, 19426678).	false

Loss-of-function alterations of IKZF1 are frequently found in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia.	The IKZF1 gene encodes the Ikaros family zinc finger 1 transcription factor (IKZF1). IKZF1 functions in hematopoietic stem cells to induce lymphoid specification and differentiation (PMID: 19345118, 16518393). As a transcription factor, IKZF1 alters chromatin and regulates gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases and chromatin remodeling ATPases to target genes (PMID: 10204490). IKZF1 is the target of lenalidomide-induced degradation in multiple myeloma and its degradation is a key component of the drug's activity in myeloma (PMID: 24292625). IKZF1 mutations and deletions are most commonly found in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) and may be a mechanism of leukemic transformation in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (BCR-ABL) B-ALLs (PMID: 17344859, 18408710). Mutation of IKZF1 is associated with poor prognosis in B-ALL (PMID: 19129520). It is also deleted more rarely in other leukemias such as acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 26069293, 25331116, 24072100).	false

IKZF3 (also Aiolos) is a transcription factor that functions as a member of the Ikaros protein family (PMID: 9560339). Ikaros family transcription factors are required for normal development of the lymphoid system (PMID: 9560339). IKZF1, IKZF2, and IKZF3 form homo- and heterodimers to increase their affinity to bind DNA and to activate hematopoietic-specific transcription (PMID: 9560339). Specifically, IKZF3 is more highly expressed in committed lymphoid progenitor cells and mediates differentiation into pre-T and pre-B cell precursors and subsequent maturation (PMID: 9155026, 9806640). In addition, IKZF3 interacts with histone modifying complexes, such as the NURD complexes, and mediates their activity during lymphocyte maturation (PMID: 10204490, 10357820). Anti-apoptosis genes, such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL, are regulated by IKZF3, leading to control of lymphocyte survival (PMID: 11714801, 10369681). Expression of IKZF3 is upregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL) (PMID: 19016725, 18184862) and missense hotspot mutations, predicted to stabilize the IKZF3 protein, have been identified in CLL (PMID: 28584254, 23415222). However, deletions in IKZF3 have been identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematopoietic malignancies, suggesting IKZF3 may function as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor (PMID: 17344859, 24212482, 24072100). Lenalidomide, a drug with efficacy in multiple myeloma and B cell malignancies, specifically targets IKZF3 and IKZF1 for proteasome-mediated degradation, which contributes to the cytotoxicity of the drug (PMID: 24292625, 24292623).	true

IL-10 is a cytokine that inhibits the secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines by regulatory T cells, activated macrophages, and other immune cells (PMID: 11244051). IL-10 expression is tightly regulated by specific transcription factors based on immune cell type, which prevents excessive immune responses and autoimmune disease (PMID: 20154735). In macrophages and dendritic cells, IL-10 is involved in the regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and can block NF-ÎºB activity (PMID: 14678266). IL-10 deficient mice develop inflammatory diseases with excessive immune responses after pathogen challenge (PMID: 24566625). Conversely, high IL-10 expression in mice has also been shown to promote an anti-tumor immune response (PMID: 18613832). IL-10 mutations have been identified in early-onset immune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (PMID: 25373860). Higher IL-10 levels are associated with more aggressive disease and increased macrophage recruitment following chemotherapy in pre-clinical models of breast cancer (PMID: 25559954) and blockade of IL-10 receptors can improve chemotherapy responses in mice (PMID: 25446896).	false

IL3 is an interleukin that is a member of the beta common (Î²c) cytokine family, which also includes IL5 and GM-CSF (PMID: 29374162, 23046136, 23535386). IL3 is highly expressed in activated T lymphocytes and is important in mediating the immune responses of mast cells, dendritic cells, and basophils (PMID: 23046136). The main receptor partner of IL3 is IL3R, a heterodimeric cell-surface receptor, which binds IL3 via the cytokine-specific Î±-subunit to recruit the shared Î²c subunit (PMID: 29374162). Initiation of IL3-IL3R signaling results in the activation of downstream effector pathways, including the JAK-STAT pathway which mediates STAT-dependent transcription of immune target genes (PMID: 18692472). IL3 signaling regulates various aspects of immune regulation including differentiation, inflammation, proliferation, and survival (PMID: 3087441, 18178860, 23535386). Increased IL3 expression in hematopoietic studies results in leukemic self-renewal and survival, suggesting that IL3 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 2439154, 10536003). Overexpression of IL3 has also been implicated in autoimmune diseases, resulting in hyper-responsiveness to IL3 stimulation (PMID: 18341658, 6430708, 28031576, 9446636, 26131743). Rearrangements involving IL3 are found in patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias, typically leading to increased IL3 expression and eosinophilic proliferation (PMID: 29424254, 3546615, 30207070).	false

IL6ST encodes gp130, a membrane glycoprotein that serves as the signal transducer for IL-6 family cytokines (PMID: 2261637). IL-6 cytokines bind to IL-6R, which leads to gp130 homodimerization and formation of a hexameric receptor complex with IL-6/IL-6R (PMID: 2261637, 19915009). gp130 then activates the JAK/STAT pathway through the effector STAT3 to regulate diverse cellular processes, including immune responses, development and hematopoiesis (PMID: 10661409, 8632998, 15650055). gp130 also mediates proliferation and cell migration independent of STAT3 by activating YAP, Notch and ERK1/2 signaling pathways (PMID: 25731159, 17256754). The activity of gp130 is negatively regulated by the inhibitor SOCS3 (PMID: 12754506). In-frame deletions in the binding site of gp130 result in the constitutive activation of the signal transducer and subsequent upregulation of its targets, including STAT3, YAP and Notch (PMID: 19020503). Mice engineered to express mutant gp130 exhibit increased STAT3 activation and rapid gastric tumorigenesis compared to wildtype (PMID: 18431520, 14699500). IL6ST is altered, mostly by in-frame deletions and missense mutations in the IL-6/IL-6R binding site, in inflammatory hepatocellular tumors (PMID: 19020503, 24501689).	false

IL7R is a component of the interleukin 7 (IL7) receptor that heterodimerizes with the common interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain. IL7R signals through the JAK-STAT pathway (PMID:15067053). IL7 regulates T, B, and NK cell development (PMID:17013389, 25729925, 23242416, 22267219, 21167753). In addition, IL7R signaling regulates VDJ and T-cell receptr (TCR) rearragements (PMID:12594950, 9858510). IL7R mutations leading to loss of function result in severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID) (PMID:9843216, 24759676). Activating mutations in IL7R result in an oncogene that signals independently of cytokine binding (PMID:21892159). Activating IL7R mutations are most commonly found in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25207766, 22237106, 21536738).	false

ING1, inhibitor of growth family member 1, is a member of the ING family, which consists of five protein-coding genes (ING1 to ING5) and a pseudogene (INGX) (PMID: 34685579). ING1 encodes a nuclear protein and component of the p53 signaling pathway that interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 (PMID: 24008732, 12015309, 11461112, 21286670). ING1 inhibits cellular proliferation via the regulation of pathways involved with apoptosis, cellular senescence, DNA repair, cell migration and invasion (PMID: 34685579, 34493070, 11461112). ING1 modulates transcription through chromatin remodeling via physical association with both histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs); this function is linked to its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects (PMID: 34493070, 12015309). While mutations in the ING1 gene are rare, reduced levels of ING1 protein have been found in breast and prostate cancers, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 24008732, 12015309, 24962136, 34685579). Overexpression of ING1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast and lung cancer cell lines and inhibits tumor metastasis in experimental mouse models (PMID: 24962136, 21286670).	true

INHA (Inhibin alpha) is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins and is the alpha subunit of inhibin A and B protein complexes, which have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and hormone secretion. In particular, INHA negatively regulates follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion from the pituitary gland (PMID: 3696240, 19602521) and mutations in the gene can lead to male infertility and ovarian failure (PMID: 25617520, 19752047). INHA deletion in mouse models leads to gonadal stromal tumors (PMID: 1448148 ), and polymorphisms in INHA are associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (PMID: 18413775), both of which are consistent with its role in the regulation of hormone secretion.	true

INHBA (inhibin beta A) is a ligand that participates in the formation of activin and inhibin protein complexes that have opposing functions in the gonads and pituitary glands. INHBA can homo- or heterodimerize to regulate follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis (PMID: 27328872). INHBA interacts with transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) transmembrane receptors and activates downstream TGF-Î² signaling (PMID: 25560921). Activin complexes have been associated with regulation of cell differentiation in the ovary, placenta, prostate, and testis (PMID: 9464268, 9207855). Rare somatic mutations in INHBA have been reported (PMID: 18948947) and overexpression of activin has been identified in several cancer types (PMID: 11511564, 9360551, 9714055, 9570994,9543140, 17143484, 9543140, 11994376, 19240652, 19308293). However, there are reports of an anti-tumorigenic effect of the activin signal in many cancers, wherein activin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis mainly through Smad-dependent pathways (PMID: 10869285, 15753386, 16140969, 19493612,22761777), suggesting that INHBA may have context-specific effects on tumor progression.	true

The primary function of INPP4A is to selectively hydrolyze the position 4 phosphate group on the inositol ring, converting PI(3,4)P2 to PI(3)P (PMID: 24069021). INPP4A is predominantly expressed in the brain and maintains the integrity of the brain by regulating excitotoxic neuronal death (PMID 20463662). INPP4A has been implicated in the suppression of cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice via downregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (PMID: 21127264, 19325558).

Germline mutations of INSR are associated with Donohue syndrome.	INSR is the insulin receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a key mediator of insulin in the regulation of glucose metabolism (PMID: 2859121, 22337149). Insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II are the natural ligands of INSR and their binding to INSR leads to receptor auto-phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of INSR targets (IRS1-4, SHC, GAB1, CBL) (PMID: 19274663).

Loss of IRF8 in murine models results in a hematopoietic malignancy, in part due to STAT5 repression of IRF8 tumor suppressive activity (PMID: 24753251). Homozygous biallelic IRF8 mutations have been identified in NK deficiency syndromes and IRF8 missense mutations have been identified in dendritic cell deficiency syndromes (PMID: 27893462, 21524210), suggesting IRF8 is required for functional NK and dendritic cell development. Somatic hotspot mutations in the IRF8 DNA binding domain have been identified in pediatric-type follicular lymphoma (PMID: 28533310) and in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PMID: 23292937). In addition, IRF8 downregulation is found in hematopoietic malignancies due to epigenetic and signaling dysregulation (PMID: 21475251, 24753251).	true

Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is one of the key mediator of Insulin receptor (INSR) signalling in cells (PMID: 1648180, 19029956). Upon activation of INSR, IRS1 is phosphorylated and activated leading to the activation of the PI3-Kinase and MAPK pathway (PMID: 1648180, 11292874, 21597332). IRS1 has oncogenic functions in multiple tumor entities such as breast cancer and high IRS1 expression is associated with adverse prognosis (PMID: 17030631, 22337149). IRS-1 associates with BCL-2 and increases its anti-apoptotic functions (PMID: 10679027). IRS-1 interacts with GRB2 leading to JAK activation (PMID: 8491186, 8536716, 9492017). ETV6-NTRK3 induced cell transformation requires high levels of IRS-1 phosphorylation (PMID: 12173038). Phosphorylation of IRS1 S307 seems to abrogate its ability to mediate insulin receptor signalling (PMID: 11606564). Drugs that specifically target the insulin receptor pathway and IRS1 activity have been developed and clinically investigated (PMID: 19581933, 20807783).	false

Insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is one of the mediators of Insulin receptor (INSR) signalling in cells (PMID: 1648180, 19029956). Upon activation of INSR, IRS2 is phosphorylated and activated leading to the activation of the AKT and MAPK pathway (PMID: 1648180, 11292874, 21597332, 24810113). Dysregulation or IRS2 leads to obesity and diabetes and IRS2 deficiency impairs brain growth (PMID: 15467829, 12904469). IRS1 has oncogenic functions in multiple tumor entities such as squamous cell carcinoma and high IRS1 expression is associated with adverse prognosis (PMID: 24810113, 17030631, 22337149). Nedd4-induced ubiquitination or IRS2 enhances IGF signalling and its mitotic activity (PMID: 25879670). IRS2 amplifications have been observed in colorectal cancer which result in increased susceptibility to anti-EGFR therapy (PMID: 26416732).	false

ITPKB, a member of the inositol trisphosphate-kinase family encodes for an inositol phosphate kinase that functions in regulating inositol phosphate metabolism in cellular signaling through phosphorylation of inositol polyphosphates (PMID: 24401760, 22981169). ITPKB is one of three isoforms in the inositol triphosphate-kinase family that share the conserved C-terminal catalytic domain but differ in regulation mechanisms (PMID: 24401760). ITPKB regulates calcium homeostasis by inhibiting calcium transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria (PMID: 12747803, 33443159). Knockdown of ITPKB in various patient-derived xenograft models represses cisplatin-resistant tumor growth mediated through NOX4 and sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin, suggesting that ITPKB functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31081803). Upregulation of ITPKB has been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer and ovarian cancer (PMID: 31081803).	false	
ENST00000342505	NM_002227.2	ENST00000342505	NM_002227.2	3716	JAK1	true			JAK1, an intracellular kinase, is frequently altered in hematologic malignancies and gynecological cancers.	The JAK1 gene encodes Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), a ubiquitously expressed member of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases (PMID: 25057888, 9096349). JAK1 forms a complex with cytokine receptors to initiate cytokine-mediated signaling. Upon cytokine activation, JAK1 forms oligodimers which phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic region of the cytokine receptors, leading to recruitment and activation of downstream targets such as STAT1-6 (PMID: 25057888). The STAT proteins then translocate to the nucleus and act as transcription factors, mediating several cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation and antigen presentation (PMID: 23406773). Several activating mutations in JAK1 have been detected in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other hematological malignancies, and inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway have been suggested as a potential therapy in those cases (PMID: 23340138). However, truncating mutations leading to loss-of-function of JAK1 have been frequently reported in gynecologic tumors and other cancers with microsatellite instability (PMID: 24154688, 29121062). Loss of JAK1 function is suggested to mediate immune escape in these tumors through impaired tumor antigen presentation and abolished JAK1-mediated interferon response (PMID: 24154688, 12576323, 29121062).	true

JAK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cytokine signaling and requires a cognate receptor to respond to extracellular cytokine signaling (PMID: 25057888, 1848670). Activated JAK2 signaling is necessary for the normal production of blood cells such as erythrocytes and thrombocytes (PMID: 9590173). Activation of JAK2 leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as STAT3/5 and MAPK, enabling the translocation of these signaling molecules to the nucleus to activate transcription (PMID: 25057888). Gain-of-function mutations in JAK2 have been identified in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, including 95% of polycythemia vera and 50% of essential thrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis malignancies (PMID: 1583762, 23009934, 25629741), suggesting that JAK2 functions predominantly as an oncogene. JAK2 fusions and activating mutations have also been identified in various leukemias and lymphomas (PMID: 9360930, 18270328). The most commonly identified mutation is JAK2 V617F, an alteration that activates kinase activity by impairing the autoinhibitory domain of the kinase, leading to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 17721432). Murine models engineered to express the JAK2 V617F mutation develop a myeloproliferative disorder (PMID: 28640953). While JAK2 mutations are rare in solid tumors, activation of the JAK2/STAT pathway has been found to be oncogenic in many tumor types (PMID: 26151455). The JAK2 kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib has been FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with high-risk myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera (PMID: 20843246). However, resistance to JAK2 inhibition has been found to occur via the formation of drug-resistant JAK1/JAK2 heterodimers (PMID: 22820254). Additional JAK2 inhibitors are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials to improve drug efficacy and reduce off-target effects (PMID: 28673391).	false

JAK3 encodes for Janus Kinase 3, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. JAK3 activation results in activation of the STAT family of proteins (PMID:8986719) and can also signal through the MAPK and AKT pathways (PMID:22120524). JAK3 regulates response to cytokines, chemokines, and metabolism (PMID:8022486, 24498424, 25493954, 26451047). JAK3 signaling plays a crucial role in T-cell development, including regulation of T-cell apoptosis (PMID:11134353). Clinically JAK3 signaling can mediate autoimmune disease and graft rejection (PMID:14593182, 26230873). JAK3 mutations are seen in acute leukemias (PMID:22237106, 16843266), myeloid and lymphoid leukemia subtypes (PMID:23832011, 24446122), and lymphomas (PMID:24837469, 23689514). JAK3 mutations are also found in solid tumors but at lower incidence (PMID:18559588, 26096009, 24821835, 21868263). Loss of function mutations in JAK3 can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (PMID:10075926).	false

JARID2 is a transcription factor that mediates the recruitment of epigenetic complexes to chromatin. JARID2 associates with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for transcriptional repression of target genes by catalyzing the placement of the repressive di- and tri-methyl Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) marks on chromatin (PMID: 20123894, 29932905, 29348366, 25620564). In addition, JARID2 binds other histone modifications in order to regulate crosstalk between PRC2 and PRC1 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1) (PMID: 27892467). PRC2 function is important in the repression of developmental regulators such as the HOX genes and X-inactivation (PMID: 16618801, 12649488). JARID2 activity is also essential in several contexts including skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue development (PMID: 29891551, 30119689). Increased JARID2 expression has been associated with proliferation, migration, and invasion in ovarian, hepatocellular, and bladder cancer cells, among others (PMID: 28765957, 28445934, 27259236, 22431509). Deletions and missense mutations are found in hematopoietic malignancies and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 22190018, 23047306, 22053108, 30423295).	true

JUN (also c-Jun) is a transcription factor that dimerizes with the Activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex. The AP-1 complex regulates a plethora of cellular process including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis through transcriptional control of several downstream target genes, including p53, cyclin D1 and EGFR (PMID: 12791272, 10072388, 10790372). In its turn, c-Jun is regulated by phosphorylation, mediated in particular by the JNK, p38 and WNT signaling pathways for directing cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and migration processes (PMID: 10080190, 16007074, 20231272). AP-1 is a potent transforming factor in multiple experimental models, although anti-oncogenic effects have also been described in specific contexts (PMID: 11988758, 14668816). Although a direct oncogenic role for AP-1 has not been described in human tumors, mechanisms for a putative role have been explored in for example breast cancer cell lines and models of liposarcoma, a tumor type in which c-Jun amplification has been observed (PMID: 17637753, 17418412).	false

KAT6A (also MYST3 or MOZ) is a histone acetyltransferase that is a member of MYST family of proteins (PMID: 16626284, 18754862, 17694081). KAT6A functions as a transcriptional coactivator that has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, with the ability to acetylate several histone residues (PMID: 11313971). In addition, KAT6A forms complexes with transcriptional regulators to coordinate gene expression, including the hematopoietic proteins AML1, PU.1, and RUNX, among others (PMID: 11742995, 16702405, 11965546, 12771199). The activity of KAT6A has been implicated in the formation of additional transcriptional complexes with ING proteins that regulate a variety of cellular processes including differentiation, DNA damage, chromatin state and cellular proliferation (PMID: 17694081). Loss of KAT6A expression in murine models results in defects in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments, consistent with a role of KAT6A in hematopoietic gene regulation (PMID: 16651658, 12676584). Dominant germline mutations in KAT6A are found in individuals with intellectual disabilities (PMID: 25728777). Recurrent translocations involving KAT6A are found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 9447825, 8782817, 9558366). KAT6A rearrangements promote leukemic transformation due to aberrant targeting of epigenetic complexes to chromatin, suggesting that KAT6A functions as an oncogene (PMID: 12676584).	false

KAT7 encodes for the catalytic subunit of the histone acetyltransferase HBO1 multimeric complex (PMID: 21753189). The HBO1 complex mediates acetylation of histone H3K14ac, regulating various processes such as transcriptional activation and immune response (PMID: 24065767, 26620551). The multimeric complex also functions in acetylation of other histones, including H4K5ac, H4K8ac and H4K12ac, to regulate DNA replication initiation and inhibit NF-kB signaling (PMID: 16997280, 19187766, 20129055). Overexpression of KAT7 in cancer cell lines induces cell growth, migration and invasion, suggesting that KAT7 functions primarily as an oncogene  (PMID: 35868058, 34039960, 19372580).

KBTBD4 is a protein that is a predicted E3 ligase adaptor protein with Kelch-BTB-BACK domains (PMID: 28726821). KBTBD4 has not yet been functionally characterized, however, it is a member of a family of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase adaptor proteins (PMID: 28726821). Adaptor molecules mediate the specificity of E3 ligase proteins, which ubiquitinate and target proteins for degradation via the proteasome (PMID: 23349464). In-frame insertions in KBTBD4, typically in the Kelch domain, have been found recurrently in patients with Group 3 or Group 4 subtypes of medulloblastoma (PMID: 28726821) and as the sole alteration in several pineal parenchymal tumors of intermediate differentiation (PPTID)(PMID: 30877433). These insertions are predicted by structural studies to occur in the substrate-binding interface of the protein (PMID: 28726821, 23349464). However, this recurrence may be limited to certain populations, as follow-up studies have demonstrated that KBTBD4 insertions were absent in a cohort of medulloblastomas from Brazilian centers (PMID: 31403685). Additional studies are required to determine the role of KBTBD4 mutations in cancer.	false

KDM5A (also known as JARID1A) is a histone demethylase for histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) (PMID:17320161). KDM5A's plant homeodomain (PHD) recognizes unmethylated H3K4 to locate the enzyme to specific chromatin regions (PMID: 25686748). Through chromatin modification and transcriptional silencing, KDM5A regulates cellular differentiation and cooperates with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in controlling cell cycle progression (PMID:18722178, 15949438, 23093672, 23112189). It also affects cellular metabolism and circadian rhythms (PMID: 26314709, 21960634). In cancer KDM5A promotes tumor progression by targeting cell cycle and angiogenesis genes and enhancing treatment resistance (PMID:23722541, 24716659, 26566863, 20371346). It is amplified in breast and head and neck cancers (PMID:22937203, 24425785). It is translocated in leukemia with the NUP98 gene and alters HOX gene expression (PMID:16419055, 19430464).	false

The KDM5C gene encodes a member of an ARID protein family that acts as an epigenetic regulator by removing di-tri-methyl groups from lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) on transcriptional targets (PMID: 21575681, 24583395, 20054297, 22249190). KDM5C is ubiquitously expressed in almost all human tissues, including white blood cells, with the highest levels of expression found in the brain and skeletal muscle (PMID: 23356856). Loss of KDM5C exerts an essential role in mammalian DNA replication. Moreover, KDM5C silencing induces aberrant H3K4me3 levels at active origins, thus halting DNA replication and ultimately S phase progression (PMID: 25712104). Mutation of the KDM5C gene was first described as causing X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in 2005 (PMID: 15586325), and has been linked to some forms of cancer (PMID: 21544224, 20181063, 20133580). The prevalence of KDM5C mutations in patients with XLID is estimated to be ~3% (PMID: 23356856), and somatic mutations in this gene have been identified in 4-9% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (PMID: 20054297, 24166983, 22138691). Knockdown of KDM5C in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) -/- ccRCC cells significantly enhanced tumor growth in a xenograft model, suggesting that KDM5C functions as a tumor suppressor in this cancer model (PMID: 21725364, 25111482). Through siRNA screen, KDM5C was identified as a mediator of the human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 tumor suppressor protein in cervical cancer (PMID: 20133580).	true

KDM5D, part of the KDM5 family, is located on the Y chromosome and encodes a male-specific histone demethylase that targets trimethylated H3K4 (PMID: 34127738, 30864186, 35805040, 26747897). KDM5D plays a role in transcriptional regulation, as the demethylation of H3K4 is suggested to repress gene transcription (PMID: 30864186, 26747897). KDM5D is associated with male organ rejection in female recipients due to a short peptide derived from the protein that is a minor histocompatibility antigen (PMID: 35805040). Down-regulation of KDM5D has been observed in various cancer types including lung, prostate, gastric, colorectal and renal cancer, and is in part due to deletions on the Y chromosome; this supports its role as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 34127738, 26747897). In both in vitro and in vivo models of prostate and gastric cancer, knock-down of KDM5D promoted cellular invasion and increased expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators such as N-cadherin, slug and vimentin (PMID: 30864186, 26747897). Overexpression of KDM5D inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and reduced the growth rate of tumors in mice (PMID: 34688635). However, KDM5D was found up-regulated in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer in male patients and was associated with increased metastases, suggesting KDM5D may function as an oncogene in this tumor-specific context through the repression of genes involved in cell adhesion and immune recognition (PMID:37344599).	true

KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) encodes a chromatin-modifying enzyme that mediates transcriptional co-activation by functioning as a di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase. KDM6A is part of the larger ASC-2 complex (ASCOM) that also contains lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C). KDM6A is located on Xp11.2, but it escapes X inactivation, resulting in bi-allelic expression in females (PMID: 9499428). Association of KDM6A with KMT2D and KMT2C couples H3K27 demethylation to H3K4 methylation (PMID: 17761849). Germline deletions and point mutations in KDM6A cause Kabuki syndrome, which is characterized by typical facial features, skeletal anomalies, dermatoglyphic abnormalities, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and postnatal short stature (PMID: 22197486, 22840376, 22901312, 23076834). Early sequencing efforts led to the discovery of inactivating KDM6A mutations in a number of human malignancies including multiple myeloma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 19330029). Later studies found KDM6A mutations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 21248752), medulloblastoma (PMID: 22722829, 22832583), adenoid cystic carcinoma (PMID: 23685749), urothelial bladder cancer (PMID: 24476821, 21822268, 25092538, 25225064), aristolochic acid-associated upper tract urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 23926199), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 25320243), and pancreatic cancer (PMID: 25719666). In prostate cancer, KDM6A mutations are seen in progression to lethal castration-resistant disease (PMID: 22722839). Loss of KDM6A may confer sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors (PMID: 28228601).	true

KDR (kinase domain receptor), also known as VEGFR2 or Flk-1, is a tyrosine kinase receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and plays a key role in angiogenesis. In hypoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) protein stabilization leads to upregulation of KDR and VEGF (PMID: 23172303). Binding of VEGF to KDR results in stimulation of angiogenesis via receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, activation of phospholipase C (PLC-gamma) and downstream signaling via protein kinase C (PKC) and RAF/MEK/ERK (PMID: 10327068, 12778165). Mutations of KDR are rare in tumors, and alterations of KDR activity typically occur via KDR amplification and subsequent overexpression. Most therapies blocking KDR signaling target the angiogenesis pathway in general, such as bevacizumab, an antibody that targets VEGF-A (PMID: 15136787).	false

KEAP1 encodes a substrate adaptor protein for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is formed by the proteins CUL3 and RBX1 and targets NRF2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PMID:15572695). NRF2 (encoded by the gene NFE2L2) is a master transcriptional regulator of the cellular antioxidant response (PMID: 24142871, 21251164). Activation of NRF2 can provide a fitness advantage for cells by upregulating pathways for handling xenobiotic stress and detoxification (PMID: 21251164). The BTB domain of KEAP1 binds CUL3, and the Kelch-repeat domain binds NRF2 via KEAP1 homodimerization (PMID:21251164). The IVR region contains critical cysteine residues whose thiol side chains are modified in response to oxidative stress. Modification of cysteine residues in the IVR disrupts binding of KEAP1 to NRF2 and CUL3, resulting in the release of NRF2 for transcriptional activation of target genes (PMID:12193649, PMID:14585973). Mutations in KEAP1 tend to occur throughout the body of the gene (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Apr. 2015), and are commonly thought to disrupt KEAP1-dependent regulation of NRF2. This disruption activates NRF2-dependent pathways, including those regulated in the oxidative stress response (PMID: 24142871).	true

The receptor is activated through dimerization and autophosphorylation upon binding by its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF) also known as mast cell growth factor (MGF) (PMID: 9438854). KIT activation results in increased intracellular signaling through several pathways including PI3K, MAPK and STAT, ultimately leading to cell proliferation and survival (PMID: 17546049, 11896121, 22089421). For patients with wildtype gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST; no KIT or PDGFRA mutations), NCCN recommends testing for germline succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations. About 10-15% of GISTs are wildtype; thus, the absence of a mutation does not exclude the diagnosis of GIST. In patients without KIT mutations, a subset of those with advanced GISTs benefit from imatinib (0-45% of patients) (NCCN Soft Tissue Sarcoma v.2.2017). Activating KIT mutations occur in 80 - 90% of GISTs and are distributed over multiple exons with different frequencies (exons 11 (66.1%), exon 9 (13%), exon 13 (1.2%), and exon 17 (0.6%)) (PMID:15365079, 17268243, 11719439). There are at least eight small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting KIT that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration with the efficacy of each TKI strongly depending on the location of the activating KIT mutation (PMID: 2427414, 18955458,19164557).	false	R2

KLF2 is a transcription factor that is a member of the Kruppel protein family (PMID: 25428260). KLF2 expression is important for maintenance of quiescence in a variety of cell types, including in non-cycling B-cells and naÃ¯ve T-cells (PMID: 17681603, 18246069, 16455954, 16455954). Transcriptional activity of KLF2 mediates the suppression of gene expression programs required for B- and T-cell activation (PMID: 17681603, 18246069). In addition, KLF2 represses the transcriptional activity of NF-ÎºB in response to stimulation from a variety of signaling pathway including Toll-like receptor (TLR) and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, among others (PMID: 25428260). Loss of KLF2 in murine models leads to expanded marginal zone B-cells, likely due to altered differentiation and homing of B cells (PMID: 20691614, 21187409). Somatic inactivating mutations in KLF2 are found in splenic marginal zone lymphoma (PMID: 25428260, 25283840), suggesting that KLF2 functions as a tumor suppressor. Loss-of-function variants in KLF2 result in unrestricted activation of NF-ÎºB, leading to constitutive activation of various B-cell related signaling pathways (PMID: 25428260).	true

KLF3 is a transcription factor that is a member of the Kruppel protein family (PMID: 21360637). KLF3 modulates epithelial homeostasis by controlling the activation of epidermal differentiation gene programs (PMID: 32659720). In addition, KLF3 functions as a transcriptional repressor in adipocyte, erythroid and chondrocyte differentiation (PMID: 32385917, 32523103, 30619490, 30324848, 29775748, 23918807). Binding of KLF3 to target genes is important for various cellular activities including differentiation, proliferation, fat accumulation, angiogenesis and inflammation (PMID: 31486564, 32213596, 27226561, 31196982). KLF3 cooperates with other transcriptional and chromatin regulators, such as CBP, CtBP2, and C/EBPÎ±, to activate gene expression (PMID: 32659720, 30619490, 25659434, 10756197). KLF family member-mediated gene regulation is complex due to the competition for binding sites across the genome at enhancers and promoters (PMID: 28541545). In various cell types, altered KLF3 activity mediates gene expression via interactions with long non-coding RNAs and micro RNAs (PMID: 31462890). KLF3 expression is downregulated in several cancer types, including lung and colon cancer, and is indicative of poor patient prognosis (PMID: 32213596, 28423541, 21470678). Somatic mutations are infrequent in human cancers and require functional validation (PMID: 21360637).	true

KLF4 is a transcription factor that regulates the development of multiple organs and tissues including the skin, cerebellum, and colon (PMID: 10431239, 12015290, 18604447, 26226504). Overexpression of KLF4 with OCT3/4, SOX2, and c-MYC is able to induce pluripotent stem cells from adult tissues (PMID: 16904174).  It is also involved in terminal differentiation of monocytes and the T-cell immune response (PMID: 18390749, 25992862). In certain cancers, KLF4 functions to regulate the differentiation of tumor cells and may have a potential tumor suppressor role (PMID: 25181544, 26113043, 26338995, 26880805, 21224073, 22284679, 26934576).

KLF5 (Kruppel-like factor 5) is a zinc-finger-containing transcription factor whose expression is highest in rapidly dividing cells, such as in the crypt epithelium of the intestinal tract or the basal layer of the dermis, and results in the induction of genes regulated by cyclin D1 (PMID: 15077182, 10767086). KLF5 binds to GC-rich regions of DNA and has antagonizing effects on gene expression compared to KLF4, another KLF family member involved in stemness and regulation of cellular differentiation (PMID: 16904174). KLF5 is important in regulating the integrity of intestinal stem cells and has been implicated as a stemness reprogramming factor (PMID: 24626089, 23112162). In tumor models, KLF5 mediates RAS-driven oncogenesis (PMID: 18054006, 15077182) and while amplification of KLF5 is implicated in gastric cancer, it is also thought to regulate breast cancer invasiveness (PMID: 26189798, 26419610).	false	
ENST00000341319	NM_130446	ENST00000341319	NM_130446	89857	KLHL6	true			KLHL6, an E3 ligase, is infrequently altered in cancer.	KLHL6 (kelch like family member 6) encodes a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac)-Kelch protein that is selectively expressed in lymphoid tissue and involved in B-cell antigen receptor signaling and germinal center B-cell maturation (PMID: 29695787, 16166635, 30646831). The protein functions as an E3 ligase through assembly with CULLIN3 to form a functional CULLIN-RING ubiquitin ligase (PMID: 29695787, 28807996, 30646831). Mutations in the KLHL6 gene may cause dissociation of CULLIN3 from KLHL6 resulting in loss of E3 ligase catalytic activity (PMID: 30646831, 29695787). KLHL6 gene mutations have been identified in patients with B-cell malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma (PMID: 29695787, 29044464, 21642962, 27959900). In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that loss of KLHL6 favors DLBCL growth and survival (PMID: 29695787, 30646831). However, KLHL6 has been found to be up-regulated in gastric cancer and is associated with a less favorable prognosis in this tumor type. Consistent with its role as an oncogene in gastric cancer, down-regulation of KLHL6 in human gastric carcinoma cells results in reduced colony formation, proliferation and viability, and suppressed tumor growth in mice (PMID: 29044464).	true

KMT2A (also MLL1) is a histone methyltransferase that functions as an epigenetic modulator that methylates lysine residue 4 on the tail of histone H3 (H3K4). Methylation of H3K4 leads to increased genome accessibility, recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and activation of gene expression (PMID: 25998713). KMT2A is crucial for embryogenesis and normal hematopoiesis by stimulating expression of several important developmental genes including the homeobox (Hox) genes (PMID: 24213472). Chromosomal translocations involving KMT2A that result in gain-of-function fusion proteins have been identified in pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and are overrepresented in therapy-related AML. Though KMT2A has a diverse group of fusion partners in leukemia, the most common KMT2A recombination partners include AF4, AF9, and ENL, which are proteins that interact with transcriptional elongation machinery (PMID: 28701730). KMT2A fusion proteins disrupt the normal activity of hematopoietic stem cells and the normal chromatin state, leading to activation of oncogenic signaling pathways (PMID: 16862118). In addition, loss-of-function mutations in KMT2A have been identified in solid tumors including bladder, stomach and endometrial cancers (PMID: 21822268, 23636398). DOT1L inhibitors, which are currently being tested in clinical trials, have been shown to have activity against KMT2A-rearranged leukemias (PMID: 21741597, 21741596).	true

KMT2C (also MLL3) is a histone methyltransferase that functions as an epigenetic modulator that methylates lysine residue 4 on the tail of histone H3 (H3K4). Methylation of H3K4 leads to increased genome accessibility, recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and activation of gene expression (PMID: 25998713). KMT2C specifically binds histones at enhancer regions, leading to increased expression of a wide range of target genes and regulation of enhancer RNA synthesis (PMID: 24081332, 23166019, 28483418, 27926873). KMT2C is ubiquitously expressed and its function is crucial for normal embryonal development and cell proliferation (PMID: 11718452, 17021013). Genetic deletion of the region containing KMT2C is the most common chromosomal abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 25794446, 11891048, 22234698, 25030029), and KMT2C is mutated in various types of cancer (PMID: 25537518, 25303977, 25151357, 28801450).	true

KMT2D (also MLL2) is a histone methyltransferase that functions as an epigenetic modulator that methylates lysine residue 4 on the tail of histone H3 (H3K4). Methylation of H3K4 leads to increased genome accessibility, recruitment of transcriptional complexes, and activation of gene expression (PMID: 25998713). Deletion of KMT2D in human cells leads to genomic instability due to transcriptional stress (PMID: 26883360). In murine models, loss of KMT2D results in accelerated B cell malignancy, impaired B cell differentiation, and defects in class switching (PMID: 26366710). KMT2D activity is critical for the survival and proliferation of KMT2A-rearranged leukemias (PMID: 28609655). Though KMT2D is not as commonly mutated as KMT2A in human cancers, KMT2D is one of the most recurrently mutated genes in follicular and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PMID: 24476821, 21804550, 21796119, 24476821).	true

KMT5A encodes the lysine methyltransferase SETD8, which specifically methylates lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me1), a histone mark implicated in DNA replication and DNA repair. KMT5A is typically bound to euchromatin regions and the placement of the H4K20me1 mark is thought to have a role in transcriptional repression (PMID: 12086618, 16517599). KMT5A is also required for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis and subsequent cellular proliferation (PMID: 15200950). Additionally, KMT5A has other methylation targets independent of histones including PCNA, Numb and p53, where methylation has roles in promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, regulating cell proliferation, and suppression of p53-dependent transcriptional programs (PMID: 26717907, 23706821, 22556262, 17707234).

KRAS is a member of the RAS family of small GTPases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Under physiologic conditions, these RAS proteins cycle between an active (GTP-bound) and an inactive (GDP-bound) state, to activate the MAPK and PI3K oncogenic pathway signaling downstream of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) (PMID: 22189424). The function of RAS enzymes is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as SOS, which enable the exchange of GDP to GTP, as well as by GTPase activating proteins, such as NF1, which increase the ability of RAS to hydrolyze GTP. Once activated, RAS mediates the regulation of cellular proliferation and other cellular functions through the activation of distinct intracellular signaling pathways, including the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Transforming mutations in KRAS are frequently found in pancreatic, colon, endometrial, ovarian and biliary cancers; almost all of these mutations result in constitutive activation of KRAS, thereby promoting cell proliferation (PMID: 21993244, 24651010). KRAS mutations occur primarily in three major hotspots, G12, G13 and Q61, the first two of which occur in the GTP-ase domain and the latter interferes with the ability of NF1 to bind and regulate KRAS (PMID: 22589270, 21993244, 24651010). Other less well-characterized mutations such as A146T/V/P and L19F have also been characterized and found to be activating albeit at lower frequencies (PMID: 20147967, 20432530, 20570890). Germline KRAS mutations are responsible for both Noonan syndrome (NS) and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome (PMID: 16474405, 16474404, 19467855, 17056636) that are associated with hyperactivated MAPK pathway, distinctive clinical characteristics and a predisposition to cancer (PMID: 19467855, 17704260).	false	R1

KSR2 is a scaffolding protein that is a member of the kinase suppressor Ras (KSR) family (PMID: 19560418). The KSR protein family has been implicated in the activation of MAPK signaling cascades via direct protein interactions and substrate localization (PMID: 19560418, 26891695). Proteomic analyses show that KSR2 interacts with several components of the MAPK signaling pathway including BRAF, MEK and ERK, as well as other proteins involved in cellular localization, including C-TAK1, 14-3-3 and PP2A1 (PMID: 19560418, 21441910). KSR2 specifically bridges the signaling molecules RAF and MEK to mediate RAF-mediated MEK phosphorylation (PMID: 11850406, 19560418, 29433126). In addition, KSR2 interacts with the phosphatase calcineurin to regulate calcium-mediated MAPK signaling (PMID: 19560418). KSR2 activity is also important for AMPK signaling and for glucose update and fatty acid oxidation (PMID: 19883615). KSR2 plays a role in negative feedback of the MAPK pathway, possibly by allosterically binding RAF (PMID: 19560418, 29433126). KSR2 is an important regulator of body fat as determined in a murine screen (PMID: 18719666). Loss of KSR2 in mice results in increased adiposity, reduced energy expenditure and insulin resistance, a phenotype consistent with human obesity (PMID: 19883615, 21127480). Germline mutations in KSR2 are associated with obesity and linked to hyperphagia, insulin resistance and impaired fatty oxidation in individuals (PMID: 24209692, 29273807). Somatic mutations in KSR2 are rare in human cancers; however, overexpression of KSR2 has been found in several cancer types including breast cancer (PMID: 21403620). Overexpression of KSR2 in preclinical studies is also associated with increased anchorage-independent growth and proliferation (PMID: 22801368). Small molecule inhibitors of KSR have shown preclinical efficacy and synergy with MEK inhibition, likely due to inhibition of negative feedback signaling (PMID: 27556948, 28333549).	false

These LARP4B-containing mRNP complexes mediate translation by serving as a bridge between protein regulators and ribosomes (PMID: 20573744). Because LARP4B has varied roles in mRNA stability and protein translation, LARP4B is important in many cellular processes including proliferation and growth control (PMID: 26001795, 32517187, 29462618). Somatic mutations in LARP4B are found in hypermutated stomach adenocarcinomas and are predicted to promote nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in loss of protein expression (PMID: 28649990). Additional studies have demonstrated that LARP4B may function as a tumor suppressor in glioma and prostate cancer (PMID: 26933087, 25534202, 31173237).

Phosphorylation of LATS1 and co-activator MOB1 by upstream kinases MST1/2 results in LATS1 activation. Under physiologic conditions, activated LATS1 phosphorylates the transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and TAZ (PMID: 19878874). Through such regulation, LATS1 controls the nuclear localization of YAP1/TAZ, thereby regulating expression of genes involved in various cellular functions including proliferation and apoptosis (PMID: 20951342, 18158288).

LCK is a tyrosine kinase that is a member of the SRC family of kinases and is important in the regulation of immune signaling pathways (PMID: 20541955). LCK is expressed predominantly on T-cells and mediates pre-T-cell receptor (TCR) and TCR signaling (PMID: 27469439). TCR signaling requires phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR after peptide-MHC molecule binding (PMID: 20541955). LCK stably binds the cytoplasmic tails of T-cell co-receptors, such as CD4 and CD8, and is recruited to the ITAMs on the TCR/CD3 co-receptor complex to facilitate ITAM phosphorylation (PMID: 2455897, 2470098). Phosphorylation of the TCR complex results in the recruitment of ZAP70, a protein kinase, which initiates LAT phosphorylation, where LAT serves as a docking site for downstream signaling cascades (PMID: 29915297). LCK can also interact with a variety of signaling molecules to mediate signaling axes including CD55, CD44 and NOTCH1, among others (PMID: 28838952, 9573028, 14583609). Overexpression of LCK in mice results in thymic tumors, suggesting that LCK can function as an oncogene (PMID: 1708890). Aberrant activation of LCK has been identified in several tumor types and rearrangements of LCK are found in lymphoid tumors (PMID: 3463975, 18316591). In addition, LCK activity has been associated with cancer stemness and metastasis in solid tumors (PMID: 30353164). Small molecule kinase inhibitors that target LCK, such as saracatinib, are currently under preclinical investigation (PMID: 28838952).	false	
ENST00000265165	NM_016269	ENST00000265165	NM_016269	51176	LEF1	true			LEF1, a T-cell and B-cell enhancer transcription factor, is infrequently altered in cancer.	LEF1, a member of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor family, encodes for a transcription factor expressed in pre-B and T cells (PMID: 10933391). LEF1 binds to the T-cell receptor-alpha enhancer to drive T-cell antigen receptor-alpha chain expression (PMID: 7958926, 2010090). LEF1 functions as a nuclear effector in the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway to regulate cellular proliferation and cellular apoptosis (PMID: 8757136, 18316418). Overexpression of LEF1 in various cancer cell lines and models induces tumorigenesis, cellular proliferation, migration and resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting that LEF1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31296250, 18316418, 34639214). Amplification of LEF1 has been identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 25942645, 26950276, 22184516).	false	
ENST00000266674	NM_003667	ENST00000266674	NM_003667	8549	LGR5	true			LGR5, a G-protein coupled receptor that regulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, is infrequently altered by amplification in cancer.	LGR5, also known as GPR5, is a G-protein coupled receptor that regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway through binding to R-spondin (PMID: 21693646, 26086949). LGR5 is a marker for adult stem cells in various organs and tissues, stimulating stem cell proliferation and self-renewal through Wnt signaling (PMID: 22969042). Rearrangement of LGR5 has been identified in glioblastoma multiforme (PMID: 25500544). Amplified LGR5 mutations have been identified in various cancer types including basal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, colorectal tumors and ovarian tumors (PMID: 16575208, 18688030). Aberrant expression of LGR5 in breast cancer cells promotes tumorigenesis through long-term potentiation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway, leading to cancer cell mobility and tumor formation (PMID: 26086949). Conversely, LGR5 has been identified as a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the context of B cells, demonstrated by upregulated nuclear beta-catenin and tumor growth suppression following ablation of LGR5 in B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Abstract: Cosgun et al. Abstract# 4515, AACR 2018. https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/78/13_Supplement/4515/628888/). Loss of LGR5 mutations have been identified in colorectal tumors (PMID: 23349017). Methylation of LGR5 promotes tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumors as measured by decreased Wnt signaling, increased risk of metastasis and tumor recurrence (PMID: 22056143). LGR5 promotes tumor suppressive activity through Wnt signaling and loss of this function through alteration promotes tumorigenicity as measured by increased invasion, anchorage-independent growth and enhanced tumorigenicity in xenograft models (PMID: 22056143, 23349017).	false	
ENST00000335790	NM_002315.2	ENST00000335790	NM_002315.2	4004	LMO1	true			LMO1, a transcriptional regulator of the cell cycle and metastasis, is altered in the germline of some patients predisposed to neuroblastoma.	LMO1 (Lim-domain-only 1, also known as TTG1 and Rhombotin 1) is a Lim-domain-only protein that functions to regulate the formation of transcriptional complexes (PMID: 23303138). The Lim-domain-only proteins (LMO1-4) are characterized by two tandemly arrayed protein interacting LIM domains. The LIM domain is similar to a zinc finger domain; however, instead of mediating DNA-interactions it mediates protein-protein interactions (PMID: 10704826). LMO1 was first described to have oncogenic functions in T-lymphoblastic leukemia. It is was found to be located near chromosome 11 translocation breakpoints leading to overexpression in these leukemias (PMID: 2034676, 2115645). LMO1 expression can drive leukemogenesis and form protein complexes with TAL1 and other proteins. LMO1 protein complexes regulate transcription of known oncogenes such as MYB, one mechanism through which LMO1 leads to leukemogenesis (PMID: 22897851, 1508213). LMO1 is also described as an oncogene in neuroblastoma. A subset of neuroblastoma is robustly associated with germline sequence variants close to the LMO1 gene (PMID: 21124317). These sequence variants lead to high LMO1 expression through differential GATA transcription factor binding (PMID: 26560027). It is clear that LMO1 is associated with poor survival and a higher risk of metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of action are not well understood (PMID: 23303138).	false

LMO2 is a transcription factor that is a member of the LIM-domain only protein family (PMID: 26108219, 20861166). LMO2 is expressed in hematopoietic cells and across many tissues during development; however, LMO2 is silenced in mature lymphoid lineages (PMID: 11248806). LMO2 regulates both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis as well as angiogenesis and maintenance of stemness (PMID: 8033210, 21343360). LMO2 functions as a member of a transcriptional complex containing TAL1, GATA1/2, RUNX1, MYB, and E-proteins, but LMO2 itself does not have any intrinsic DNA binding ability, acting predominantly to mediate protein-protein interactions (PMID: 25466247, 9214632). LMO2 is dependent on the binding of other proteins for stability, and these interactions are context-dependent (PMID: 26598604). LMO2 predominantly functions as a bridging protein to coordinate the binding of transcriptional complexes across GATA and E-box motifs and serves as an LDB1 docking site to activate enhancers at erythroid genes (PMID: 28636938). Increased expression of LMO2 in murine models results in a differentiation block, resulting in an accumulation of immature thymocyte progenitors (PMID: 8605871, 7579400). In combination with TAL1 activation or NOTCH1 mutations, LMO2 expression in thymocytes results in enhanced tumor-initiating properties (PMID: 8605871, 21670468). LMO2 also functions as the driver oncogene in X chromosome-linked severe combined immuno-deficiency syndrome therapy associated leukemias (PMID: 14985489). LMO2 overexpression is common in patients with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), due to recurrent deletions or translocations that fall upstream of LMO2, resulting in activation (PMID: 20861166, 26998100, 16873670, 25682596), suggesting that LMO2 functions predominantly as an oncogene.	false

LRP1B, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, functions in various cellular functions such as signal transduction, DNA damage response, synaptic transmission and cell migration (PMID: 19071120, 15082773). LRP1B interacts with cytosolic adapter and scaffold protein binding partners through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis or its intracellular domain (PMID: 19071120). The LRP1B intracellular domain is soluble and is released from the extracellular domain through regulated intramembrane proteolysis cleavage (PMID: 17227771). The cleaved LRP1B intracellular domain localizes to the nucleus via nuclear localization signaling and mediates transcriptional activity through interactions with various binding partners (PMID: 17227771). LRP1B-deficient cancer cells demonstrate anchorage-independent growth and the inability to suppress colony formation, suggesting that LRP1B functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 17227771, 20095042, 27499094). Loss of LRP1B has been identified in various different cancers, including prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma (PMID: 31270961, 27939411, 30719154). Epigenetic silencing of LRP1B, for example hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, has also been identified in different cancers, which include thyroid cancer and renal cell cancer (PMID: 27499094, 23521319). Loss of LRP1B is suggested to contribute to resistance to liposomal therapies such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, due to dysfunction in endocytic activity affecting drug uptake (PMID: 22896685).	true

Germline mutations in LRP5 are associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and bone loss disorders.	LRP5 is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the LDL-related protein family (PMID: 28979801, 17143291). LRP5 interacts with the co-receptors LRP6 and Frizzled family members at the plasma membrane following WNT ligand binding, leading to initiation of WNT-mediated downstream signaling (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID:  28218291). LRP5/6 binding by WNT ligands results in phosphorylation of CK1Î± and GSK3Î², which recruit the signaling molecule DVL to the plasma membrane for polymerization and activation (PMID: 23258168, 19619488). DVL inactivates the Î²-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3Î² and AXIN) due to recruitment of AXIN to the co-receptor complex, allowing Î²-catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus (PMID: 23258168). In the nucleus, Î²-catenin associates with the transcription factors LEF and TCF, displacing the repressive TLE proteins and forming transcription factor complexes that promote the expression of Î²-catenin target genes (PMID: 23258168, 19619488). LRP5 can also interact with antagonists of WNT, like the Dickkopf (DKK) proteins or SOST, to inhibit WNT activation (PMID: 17052975). Germline mutations in LRP5 have been identified in several malignancies including familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), which causes progressive vision loss, and diseases related to altered bone mass (PMID: 15024691, 20340138, 28341377). LRP5 mutations have been identified in various cancer types, though the functional role of these alterations has not yet been carefully elucidated (PMID: 31575382, 19158955, 18044981, 16266997, 19619488). However, mutations in LRP5 are predicted to result in deregulation of WNT signaling.	true

LRP5/6 also have roles in the regulation of tissue homeostasis and intestinal epithelial development (PMID: 31412666). Germline mutations in LRP6 are associated with several malignancies including tooth agenesis, bone mass disorders, early coronary disease and neural tube defects (PMID: 26387593, 26963285, 31085352, 24203697, 17332414). LRP6 mutations have been identified in various cancer types; however, the functional role of these alterations have not yet been carefully elucidated (PMID: 25500543, 15064719). However, overexpression of LRP6 is found in a variety of cancer types, including liver, breast and colorectal cancer, suggesting that LRP6 predominantly functions as an oncogene (PMID: 31412666, 20194742).	false	
ENST00000376117	NM_002341.1	ENST00000376117	NM_002341.1	4050	LTB	true			LTB, a tumor suppressor involved in inflammatory signaling, is recurrently mutated in multiple myeloma.	LTB (also TNF-C) is a lymphotoxin or cytokine that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of ligands (PMID: 8621492). LTB forms a heterotrimeric complex with another TNF family member, LTÎ± (one subunit of LTÎ±; two subunits of LTB), which is termed the lymphotoxin protein complex (PMID: 8621492, 27323847). The lymphotoxin protein complex is found on the surface of activated T-, B- and natural killer cells (PMID: 27323847) and serves as the primary ligand for the lymphotoxin beta receptor, which is found on nonlymphoid cells (PMID: 27323847, 8621492). LTB activity is important for follicular dendritic cell development in germinal centers and is an important chemoattractant relevant for B-cell homing to follicles in the lymph node and spleen (PMID: 10917533, 10049949). Lymphotoxin signaling is necessary for normal lymphoid tissue organogenesis and maintenance (PMID: 9256477) and for regulation of stromal cell expression of chemokines in tissues such as the spleen (PMID: 9892622). LTB induces the expression of cytokines and chemokines that promote a positive feedback loop to recruit immune cells (PMID: 10917533, 27323847). Loss of LTB expression in mice results in reduced follicular dendritic cell development, impaired B-cell memory and abnormal lymphoid tissue development (PMID: 9256477). In addition, LTB is a regulator of NF-KB-mediated inflammatory signaling (PMID: 8798772, 28196873). Inflammatory gene expression signatures in autoimmune patients have been linked to lymphotoxin signaling, such as in rheumatoid arthritis (PMID: 25405351). Somatic mutations in LTB are found in patients with multiple myeloma and are predicted to be loss-of-function (PMID: 24429703, 28550183, 26282654). In addition, LTB overexpression has been linked to cancers that are driven by inflammation, such as hepatocellular carcinomas (PMID: 19800575).	true

LTK (leukocyte tyrosine kinase) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is activated by the FAM10A/B proteins (PMID: 31227593, 25331893, 26630010). LTK is a member of the insulin receptor family and is closely related to ALK, with 79% sequence similarity among the tyrosine kinase domains and sensitivity to ALK inhibitors (PMID: 9223670, 31227593, 22347506, 25331893). LTK is normally expressed in pre-B lymphocytes and neuronal tissues (PMID: 9223670, 31227593). When bound to its ligands, LTK phosphorylates Shc and IRS-1 to activate downstream Ras signaling, thus promoting cell growth and inhibiting apoptosis (PMID: 8910363). Activated LTK also transmits anti-apoptotic signals through the PI3-kinase pathway by phosphorylating c-Cbl (PMID: 9223670). Kinase domain mutations in LTK lead to constitutive phosphorylation of the receptor and activation of downstream signaling targets including Shc, ERK, JAK1 and JAK2 (PMID: 22347506). LTK kinase domain mutants also transform epithelial cells and induce neural outgrowth in vitro (PMID: 22347506). LTK is involved in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein export, such that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of LTK leads to significantly fewer ER exit sites compared to wildtype/untreated cells (PMID: 31227593). While LTK is overexpressed among acute myeloid leukemia samples, alteration of LTK in human cancers is not well-characterized (PMID: 14977821).	false

The LYN gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family (PMID: 9202419). LYN is involved in immune responses, B-cell signaling, signal transduction of growth factors and response to DNA damage, among other functions (PMID: 19290919, 10574931, 11825908, 11435302). LYN is a mediator that can positively or negatively regulate different processes depending on the cellular and physiological context (PMID: 15664155). LYN has been described to promote tumor growth, invasion, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ERK signaling in different cancer contexts (PMID: 20215510, 22490227, 22731636). The LYN gene is typically altered by amplification in various tumors, including prostate, breast and ovarian cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016).

LZTR1 is a ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein that is a member of the BTB/POZ family (PMID: 30442762). LZTR1 functions as a scaffolding component of the CUL3 E3-ligase complex that targets substrate proteins to the proteasome for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (PMID: 23917401, 30442762). The oncogene RAS is ubiquitinated by the LZTR1-CUL3 complex which is essential for the normal protein turnover of RAS (PMID: 30442762). In addition, LZTR1 also binds RAF1, a signaling molecule in the MAPK pathway (PMID: 30368668). Loss of LZTR1 expression in hematopoietic cell lines results in enhanced MAPK signaling, reduced RAS ubiquitination, and increased association of RAS at the plasma membrane (PMID: 30442762). Germline mutations in LZTR1 have been identified in patients with Noonan syndrome and schwannomatosis (PMID: 24362817, 25335493, 25795793, 30481304). Somatic loss-of-function variants in LZTR1 are also found in patients with glioblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (PMID: 28622513), leading to activation of MAPK signaling due to RAS stabilization (PMID: 30442762). Reduced LZTR1 expression in preclinical studies results in resistance to several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, ponatinib, and rebastinib, due to constitutively active RAS signaling (PMID: 30442762).	true

MAD2L2 (also MAD2B and REV7) is a DNA repair protein that functions as an adaptor protein in several DNA repair-associated complexes (PMID: 25896508, 30154076). MAD2L2 is the non-catalytic subunit of polymerase zeta, which functions as an error-prone DNA polymerase that bypasses DNA lesions during replication (PMID: 19258535, 31410467). The H2AX-53BP1 checkpoint complex recruits MAD2L2 to double strand breaks leading to blockage of homologous recombination (HR) (PMID: 25799992). MAD2L2 then promotes non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), including at unprotected telomeres, by inhibiting 5â end resection downstream of 53BP1 and RIF1 (PMID: 25799990, 30046110, 30022168). MAD2L2-mediated NHEJ is important for specific cellular functions such as immunoglobulin class switch recombination (PMID: 25799992). MAD2L2 is also a member of the mitotic assembly checkpoint that prevents activation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) during metaphase (PMID: 25896508). Overexpression of MAD2L2 has been found in several cancer types likely contributing to genomic instability (PMID: 17044027). In addition, MAD2L2-dependent translesion synthesis is predicted to contribute to error-prone repair after chemotherapy and, therefore, small molecule inhibitors targeting polymerase zeta are under development (PMID: 31178121). Loss of MAD2L2 activity has been implicated as a mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1-deficient patients, due to a switch to HR repair; however, HR restoration may render these cancers radiosensitive (PMID: 25799992, 29789392).	true

MAF is a transcription factor that is a member of the AP1 protein family (PMID: 19143053). MAF, along with MAFA and MAFB, are categorized as large MAF proteins that regulate gene expression via transactivation domains (PMID: 19143053). MAF coordinates DNA binding as a homodimer, or a heterodimer in complex with other MAF family members (PMID: 19143053), and recruits co-activators (such as EP300, CREBBP, KAT2B, and TBP) to initiate transcription (PMID: 11943779, 18042454, 15328344). MAF activity regulates a variety of cellular processes including migration, cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and cell-cell interactions, among others (PMID: 19143053, 16247450, 14998494). In addition, tightly regulated MAF expression is important for context-specific control of transcriptional programs during development and terminal differentiation (PMID: 17569705). The activity of large MAF proteins is also mediated by competition with small MAF proteins for the same binding site (PMID: 8552399). Loss of MAF in murine models results in altered cytokine expression with implications for immune regulation while increased expression of MAF leads to transformation (PMID: 10403649, 16424013, 16247450). Germline mutations in MAF are found in lens development disorders such as pulverulent cataracts (PMID: 12642301). Overexpression of MAF is common in multiple myelomas and T-cell lymphomas, suggesting that MAF predominantly functions as an oncogene (PMID: 19143053). Rearrangements involving MAF and the immunoglobulin gene are recurrent in multiple myelomas and predicted to be a primary initiating event in the disease (PMID: 9616139, 18070707).	false

In addition, tightly regulated MAFB expression is important for context-specific control of transcriptional programs during development and terminal differentiation (PMID: 17569705, 28025141, 8620536). The activity of large MAFB proteins is also mediated by competition with small MAF proteins for the same binding site (PMID: 8552399). Forced expression of MAFB in murine models results in plasma cell neoplasms (PMID: 16424013).

MAL2, a member of the MAL proteolipid family, is an essential transmembrane protein for the basolateral-to-apical transcytotic pathway (PMID: 11549320, 14576188). MAL2 traffics vesicles from the subapical compartment to fuse with basal cargo-containing endosomes and then subsequently traffics basal cargo vesicles back to the apical surface (PMID: 12370246, 16445687, 20493814). The transcytotic function of MAL2 is regulated by binding partners INF2 and CDC42 (PMID: 20493814). Overexpression of MAL2 in human colorectal cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that MAL2 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 35847380). Despite functioning as a tumor suppressor gene, upregulation of MAL2 has been identified in various epithelial-derived cancers such as breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (PMID: 28562687, 32990678, 19287191). This is suggested to be due to the amplification of chromosomal region 8q24.12 enhancing expression of both MAL2 and known oncogene MYC (PMID: 32059473). The enhanced MAL2 expression is predicted to be associated with earlier stages of cancer progression and eventually, its expression is repressed during metastases as MYC expression increases (PMID: 32059473).	true

MALT1 is a mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1, a cysteine paracaspase. MALT1 cleaves multiple substrates including BCL10, RELB, and TNFAIP3, and promotes NFkB signaling (PMID: 21873235,18223652,18264101). It associates with CARMA1 and BCL10 to form a complex (CBM) with scaffold function to recruit proteins important for signaling (PMID:24074955,15125833). MALT1 activity is employed in B-cell and T-cell antigen receptor activation and IL2 production (PMID: 23706741, 14614861, 14576442). Germline mutation can lead to immunodeficiency (PMID: 25627829, 23727036). MALT1 is translocated with partner API2 (BIRC3) in Mucosal-associated B-cell lymphomas (PMID: 10339464). The fusion protein causes dimerization and activation of NFkB (PMID: 11262391). MALT1 can also be amplified or overexpressed by translocation with the IgH chain locus in non-Hodgkins lymphomas (PMID: 12560219). MALT1 activity was found to be critical for the growth of activated B-cell type Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) (PMID: 19897720). Inhibitors of MALT1 proteolytic activity are in development for lymphoma therapy (PMID: 23238016).	false

MAP2K1 (also known as MEK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an effector protein in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). The MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and transcription (PMID: 25435214, 17496922). As a component of a three-tiered MAPK cascade, MEK1 activity is dependent on phosphorylation by upstream RAF kinases. Activated MEK1 in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases1/2) which then serves as a transcriptional regulator (PMID: 22177953). These signaling events are triggered by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones that activate upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, ultimately leading to altered expression of key regulators of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and survival (PMID: 9069255, 11242034). Dysregulation of MEK1 signaling is commonly associated with genetic alterations in RAS and RAF (PMID: 12068308, 12509763). Hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway is frequently observed in human cancers, such as melanoma, colorectal and lung cancers; however, oncogenic mutations in MEK1 in primary tumors are infrequent (PMID: 22753777, 25351745). The MEK1/2 inhibitors trametinib and cobimetinib are FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma in combination with RAF inhibition and preclinical and clinical efforts are ongoing to determine the efficacy of MEK1 inhibition for other indications (PMID: 25435214). Some MEK1 mutations may confer resistance to both MEK and RAF inhibitors and can arise as a resistance mechanism to RAF inhibition (PMID: 19915144, 21383288).	false

Hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway is frequently observed in human cancers; however, oncogenic mutations in MAP2K2 in primary tumors are infrequent (PMID: 24840079). Because of its major role in signaling as a RAF oncogene effector, several inhibitors of wildtype MEK2 and its close structural and functional homolog, MEK1, have been developed (PMID: 20149254, 24840079). The MEK1/2 inhibitors trametinib and cobimetinib are FDA-approved for the treatment of melanoma in combination with RAF inhibition and preclinical and clinical efforts are ongoing to determine the efficacy of MEK1/2 inhibition for other indications (PMID: 25435214).

MAP2K4 is a dual specificity kinase that directly phosphorylates and activates JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAP kinase (PMID: 7716521). MAP2K4 itself is phosphorylated and activated by one of several upstream MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKK). The activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways occurs in response to a variety of environmental stressors, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, heat shock, ionizing radiation, as well as inflammatory cytokines and growth factors (PMID: 17496914,19629069). Activation of these signaling pathways leads to altered transcriptional activity of downstream effector molecules such as c-Jun, p53, ELK1, ATF2 and several other transcription factors involved in apoptosis, cell survival, growth and differentiation (PMID: 17496914,19629069). Inactivating mutations in MAP2K4 have been identified in a variety of tumor cell lines and human cancers, suggesting that MAP2K4 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 9331070, 9622070, 17496914, 22522925). Loss of heterozygosity of the 17p chromosomal region, where MAP2K4 is located in close proximity to TP53, is observed at a high frequency in many cancers (PMID: 16721048, 16627982, 19603523). In addition, MAP2K4 has been found to act as a suppressor of metastasis in prostate and ovarian cell lines (PMID: 10554023, 12438272).	true

The MAP3K1 gene encodes MEKK1, a kinase that signals in the pro-oncogenic MAP-kinase and JNK signaling pathways. MAP3K1 is unique among the MAPK signaling molecules in that it also acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for ERK1/2, thus allowing for the regulation of pathway output (PMID: 12049732, 25613373). Activation of MAP-kinase and JNK pathways occurs in response to a variety of stimuli such as environmental stress, inflammatory cytokines, pro-apoptotic signals and growth factors (PMID: 10639576, 9528810, 8621725, 11784851, 9078260). Activated MAP3K1 phosphorylates downstream effector molecules such as MAP2K4/7, MAP2K1/2, IKK alpha/beta and other transcription factors involved in apoptosis, cell survival, growth and differentiation (PMID: 7997270, 7624324, 9008162, 12471242) leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways. Germline mutations in MAP3K1 disrupt normal sex development and cause 46,XY sex development disorder (PMID: 21129722, 24135036). Truncating mutations and deletions in MAP3K1 mutations have been identified in breast cancer, predominantly in the luminal A subtype (PMID: 24386504), suggesting that MAP3K1 functions as a putative tumor suppressor. MAP3K1 may also promote oncogenesis and metastasis in some contexts. Elevated MAP3K1 expression has been found in human melanoma samples (PMID: 24003131) and MAP3K1 plays a pro-metastatic role in some cancers, as demonstrated by experimental studies in breast and pancreatic cancer models (PMID: 19513748, 16568086).	true

MAP3K13 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the JNK signaling pathway. MAP3K13 phosphorylates MAPK8 (JNK) and MAP2K7, resulting in activation of the JNK pathway (PMID: 11163770, 8637721), which is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and extracellular stresses (PMID: 11163770) and functions as a regulator of cellular proliferation, apoptosis and morphogenesis (PMID: 9561845). Through the leucine/isoleucine zipper domain, MAP3K13 forms dimers or oligomers with other proteins, such as JNK interacting protein (JIP-1), an interaction that is essential for the activation of MKK7 in the JNK signaling cascade (PMID: 9353328, 11163770, 11726227). In addition, MAP3K13 has been found to interact with PRDX3 and regulates the activation of NF-ÎºB in the cytosol (PMID: 12492477). MAP3K13 mRNA is found primarily in the pancreas, with lower levels of expression in the brain, liver and placenta (PMID: 9353328). Amplification and loss-of-function mutations in MAP3K13 are found in various solid tumors, including breast, lung cancer, and melanoma (PMID: 22722201, 22817889, 28760853).	false

MAP3K14 (also NIK) is a serine/threonine kinase which is an important signaling molecule in the noncanonical NF-kB pathway (PMID: 15485626). Following ligand stimulation, the TRAFT2/3 ubiquitin ligase complex releases MAP3K14, which then phosphorylates and activates IKK-Î±. IKK-Î± homodimers phosphorylate and activate a precursor protein of the NF-kB complex, p100, triggering its cleavage and ultimately activation of the NF-kB cascade (PMID: 11520989, 11239468, 22435551). Through its role in NF-kB signaling, MAP3K14 influences a wide range of cellular processes, including regulation of B- and T-cells (PMID: 14764671, 16034105, 18799149, 10878354, 10637282), production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (PMID: 18997792, 18997794), formation of osteoclasts (PMID: 12939342) and response to viral infection (PMID: 9182687, 20685151, 18550535). Mice lacking MAP3K14 are immunodeficient, with a reduced B-cell population and a lack of lymph nodes (PMID: 11069060, 10878354, 8605936, 25406581), highlighting the importance of MAP3K14 in immune regulation. Overexpression of MAP3K14 has been linked to lethal liver inflammation and fibrosis. In obese mice, high levels of MAP3K14 result in hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance (PMID: 22581287, 25088600). MAP3K14 overexpression caused by amplification or translocation has been observed in various hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma (PMID: 17692804, 17692805, 21881048, 22469134).

"MAX (Myc-associated factor X) is a transcription factor that is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family (PMID: 8479534, 2006410). MAX functions at the center of a transcription factor network that governs many aspects of cell behavior, inducing cell proliferation, by binding to enhancer-boxes containing the CANNTG sequence (PMID: 16908182, 1557420). MAX lacks a transactivation domain, and thus MAX homodimers act as transcriptional repressors (PMID: 9824157). However, MAX also dimerizes with other bHLHZs such as MYC, MAD or MXL1 (PMID: 12553908). Heterodimers of MYC/MAX can bind and transactivate gene expression and promote cell proliferation and apoptosis. MAX is expressed in different splice-isoforms, each having different functions (PMID: 10229200, 1566084, 8426752). A ""delta MAX"" isoform, truncated at its C-terminus, appears to enhance MYC-driven tumorigenesis, whereas full-length MAX suppresses MYC-driven tumorigenesis (PMID: 1566084). Chromosomal rearrangements involving the MAX gene location at 14q22-q24 are common in several malignancies such as malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and uterine leiomyomas (PMID:1594250).

Expression of MDB6 is most predominant in the brain and testes (PMID: 20700456, 16713569). MBD6 localizes to heterochromatin regions of DNA; however, this interaction is independent of DNA methylation (PMID: 20700456). MBD6 interacts with the Polycomb Repressive-Deubiquitinase Complex (PR-DUB), which removes monoubiquitin at lysine 119 on histone H2A, a critical protein complex involved in gene repression (PMID: 20436459, 24634419). The interaction of MBD6 with PR-DUB is mutually exclusive with family member MBD5, suggesting functional redundancies (PMID: 24634419). In addition, MBD6 binds to sites of DNA damage independent of PR-DUB (PMID: 24634419). MBD6 was also found to interact with the RNA binding protein ATXN1 in neuronal cells, and the protein has been implicated in self-renewal and cellular proliferation (PMID: 16713569, 23052207). Germline mutations in MBD6 are found in patients with autism and Wilsonâs disease, a metabolic disorder which stems from accumulation of copper in tissues due to defective biliary excretion (PMID: 30230192, 23055267).

Together with BCL2, MCL1 regulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and activation of caspases (PMID: 21763611, 20683470). Genome-wide studies have identified increased gene copy numbers of MCL1 across many cancer entities (PMID: 20164920). Focal amplifications of MCL1 were found in over 10% of cancers and were even higher in lung and breast cancers (PMID: 20164920). MCL1 expression can drive lymphomagenesis (PMID: 9787159) and is required for lung adenocarcinoma formation (PMID: 21406400), possibly through interaction with AKT (PMID: 31662324). Through inhibition of apoptosis, MCL1 leads to increased survival of cancer cells and resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli (PMID: 23478333). Therapies targeting MCL1 and other BCL2 family members are being developed and are currently under investigation (PMID: 26045609).	false	
ENST00000376406	NM_014641.2	ENST00000376406	NM_014641.2	9656	MDC1	false			MDC1 is a regulator of the cell cycle response to DNA damage. It has tumor suppressor functions in the context of cancer.	Mediator of DNA damage check point protein 1 (MDC1) is a key regulator of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage (PMID: 12607005, 14519663). MDC1 binds to sites of DNA double-stranded breaks through its SDT domain, which binds to the MRN complex, and its BRCT domain which binds to phospho-H2AX (PMID: 16377563, 11741547, 16618811, 15201865). The main functions of MDC1 are to regulate the cell cycle check points in S and G2/M phase through Chk1/2 and to regulate TP53 apoptotic response to DNA damage (PMID: 12607005, 11100718, 12607004, 12607003, 16427009). MDC1 binds TP53 through its BRC1 domain which inhibits TP53 transactivation domain (PMID: 17535811, 24194938). Loss of MDC1 results in genomic instability and promotes oncogenesis in a variety of cancer entities (PMID: 17546051). In some cancers, however, oncogenic functions of MDC1 have been observed (PMID: 21853275).	false

The MDM2 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates the p53 tumor suppressor protein (PMID: 8875929, 1535557, 25550083). The MDM2-p53 interaction blocks the activation domain of p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity (PMID: 8875929, 25550083, 7686617). Additionally, the MDM2-p53 interaction results in increased proteasomal degradation of the p53 protein (PMID: 8653711, 9153396, 9153395, 9382809). Transcription of the MDM2 gene is directly activated by p53, and levels of both p53 and MDM2 are maintained at low levels in unstressed cells (PMID: 8265599, 8440237, 8319905). Cells may acquire oncogenic potential from p53 loss (50% of tumors) or MDM2 amplification, which cripple the p53 pathway in tumor cells (PMID: 10549356, 23161690, 9671804, 20025780). Recently, numerous studies targeting the interaction between p53 and MDM2 have resulted in the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing p53 levels in tumor cells (PMID: 14704432, 15715460, 16759082, 15956260, 17126603, 14704432, 15715460, 16759082, 15956260, 17126603).	false

MDM4 is a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, the most frequently inactivated gene in human cancer (PMID: 25960041, 22154076). The two major negative regulators of p53, MDM2 and MDM4, function by blocking its N-terminal transactivation domain (PMID: 21730163). In addition, MDM4 stimulates the MDM2-catalysed ubiquitination of p53 which leads to its degradation (PMID: 14507994, 12162806). Similar to MDM2, MDM4 is deregulated in several tumor types such as cutaneous melanoma, primary breast tumors, retinoblastomas (PMID: 17080083), Ewing sarcomas (PMID: 21098696) and gliomas (PMID: 22820643, 15199139, 12640683, 11280734). In the overwhelming majority of cases, cells with deregulated MDM2 or MDM4 retain wild-type p53 (PMID: 23303139). Thus, inhibition of the p53 interaction with MDM2 or MDM4 is an attractive candidate strategy for the treatment of cancer via the reactivation of p53 (PMID: 25621298, 21098696, 20080970, 14704432, 25201201, 23374098, 16905541, 16540668).	false

MECOM (also EVI1) is a transcription factor that is encoded by the MDS1 and EVI1 complex (MECOM) gene locus (PMID: 26729571). MECOM expression is restricted to long and short term hematopoietic stem cells and is transcriptionally silent during hematopoietic differentiation (PMID: 21666053). MECOM functions as a DNA binding protein that regulates the expression of many hematopoietic genes, including SPI1, a master regulator of myelopoiesis (PMID: 30315161). In addition, MECOM activity regulates additional cellular functions including proliferation, apoptosis, and chromatin state (PMID: 28538183). MECOM was identified as an oncogene in retroviral integration assays, which revealed that MECOM could transform murine hematopoietic cells (PMID: 2542863, 2827004). Increased expression of MECOM in hematopoietic assays and murine models leads to ineffective differentiation and skewing towards the expansion of myeloid populations (PMID: 1370341, 8321231). Recurrent MECOM rearrangements are found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 19016745, 15156182), resulting in increased EVI1 activity. Overexpression of MECOM is also common in myeloid malignancies and breast cancers, suggesting that MECOM functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 18272813, 28209621). EVI1 alterations may require cooperation with other genetic events to drive transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 17227832).	false

MED12 plays a role in the genesis of benign tumors such as uterine leiomyoma and breast fibroadenoma and is altered in a variety of estrogen-dependent tumors.	MED12 is a component of the CDK8 subcomplex that is involved in transcription initiation. The MED12 protein is essential for activating CDK8 kinase. The CDK8 subcomplex which includes MED13, CDK8 kinase and cyclin C, modulates mediator-polymerase II interactions thereby regulating transcription initiation and reinitiation rates (RefSeq August 2009). The most commonly seen mutations in MED12 are in exon 2. Mutations in this domain have been described in uterine leiomyomas (PMID: 25108465, 24980722, 23443020, 23738515), breast fibroadenomas (PMID: 25038752), and Phyllodes tumors of the breast (PMID: 25593300). In benign breast tumors, MED12 hotspot mutations are thought to be early events that lead to deregulation of estrogen signaling (PMID: 25593300). MED12 is the most frequently mutated gene in uterine leiomyomas, suggesting it has a major role in the development of these lesions (PMID: 25108465). MED12 somatic exon 2 mutations have also been described in uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (PMID: 23132392). The presence of the same MED12 mutations in uLMS as in uterine leiomyomas suggests that a subgroup of the malignant tumors may develop from a leiomyoma precursor. Leucine (L) to Phenylalanine (F) mutations at amino acid 1224 have been described in prostate cancer. These mutations are thought to play a role in tumorigenesis via perturbation of transcriptional programs linked to p53 and androgen signaling (PMID: 22610119).	true

MEF2B is a transcription factor that has a role in mediating differentiation in heart and skeletal muscle (PMID: 17959722). MEF2B regulates transcriptional programs that facilitate cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as the cancer genes MYC, TGFB1, CARD11, RHOB and NDRG1 (PMID: 26245647). Consistent with a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, overexpression of MEF2B in human cell lines results in increased cell migration (PMID: 26506234). MEF2B has been found to be amplified in several cancer types including ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas, adrenocortical carcinomas and esophageal carcinomas (PMID: 26506234). Recurrent somatic mutations in MEF2B have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (PMID: 21796119, 22343534, 21804550, 23292937), follicular lymphoma (FL) (PMID: 21796119) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (PMID: 24145436). The recurrence of MEF2B mutations at particular residues is consistent with the notion that MEF2B mutations have either gain-of-function or dominant negative effects on MEF2B activity. Mutations in MEF2B in DLBCL lead to increased transcription of BCL6, a proto-oncogene essential for DLBCL germinal center proliferation and decreased association with the co-repressor CABIN1 (PMID: 23974956). However, other data suggest that MEF2B mutations lead to loss of DNA binding and decreased DLBCL cell chemotaxis (PMID: 26245647).	false

MEF2C, a Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 family transcription factor, is an early expressed gene that is a direct transcriptional target of ETS transcription factors and which binds to the MEF2 element in muscle-specific genes to promote muscle differentiation. In addition to its role in myogenesis, MEF2C expression is critical for the development of the neural system, vascular endothelium, heart and bone (PMID: 15501228, 29340119). MEF2C has been shown to have a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation, particularly germinal center formation in B-cells (PMID: 18955699). Germline haploinsufficiency of MEF2C has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders associated with cognitive disability and epilepsy, highlighting its importance in neural differentiation (PMID: 23389741). In cancer, MEF2C contributes to oncogenicity by enhancing the invasion and stemness of cancer cells, and may act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on the cancer context (PMID: 16862118, 23435431, 21481790, 25328135, 24043307, 25404735).	true

MEF2D is a transcription factor that is a member of the myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) protein family (PMID: 29879430). Gene expression programs necessary for muscle, neuronal, and B-cell differentiation, among other cell types, are modulated by MEF2D activity (PMID: 20716948, 26660426). MEF2D predominantly functions as a transcriptional activator and interacts with other co-activators and chromatin-modifying proteins (e.g. MYOD, p300 and PCAF) to regulate context-specific target gene expression (PMID: 20716948, 32512162, 32512162, 31722213). However, MEF transcription factors can also function as transcriptional repressors (PMID: 28419090). MEF2D expression is important for a variety of cellular activities including proliferation, DNA damage response and cell cycle progression (PMID: 29879430, 24672010, 26506234). The activity of MEF2D has also been linked to the regulation of oxidative stress and pro-survival gene programs (PMID: 2512162). Aberrant MEF2D localization and activity have been linked to cancer progression in a variety of cancer types (PMID: 28419090, 29218083, 25814384). In B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), MEF2D translocations occur between recurrent partner proteins including DAZAP1, FOXJ2, SS18 and BCL9 (PMID: 28778863, 30630978) and are associated with poor patient outcome (PMID: 27824051). MEF2D fusion proteins demonstrate oncogenic activity by increasing MEF2D transcriptional activity, HDAC9 expression, and cellular transformation (PMID: 27507882, 27824051).

MEN1 is a putative tumor suppressor gene that localizes to the nucleus (PMID: 19068082). The function of MEN1 is not well-understood as MEN1 does not share sequence homology with any other known proteins (PMID: 19068082). MEN1 interacts with multiple proteins that play critical roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, including JunD, SMAD, and activator of S-phase kinase (PMID:16740708, 9103196, 9215690). In addition, MEN1 binds several histone regulatory proteins and is predicted to be a transcriptional regulator (PMID: 19068082). Germline loss-of-function mutations in MEN1 are associated with MEN1 syndrome, a disease that causes tumors in the pituitary, parathyroid, lung, and enteropancreatic endocrine tissues (PMID: 14992727).

MGA (MAX-gene associated protein) is a dual-specificity transcription factor that regulates the expression of MAX-target genes and T-box family target genes. MAX is a transcription factor that heterodimerizes with other basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZ) family members, including MYC and MXI1, to regulate the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation. As part of this network, MGA contains a MYC-like bHLHZip motif and heterodimerize with MAX to bind to MYC-MAX DNA binding sites (PMID: 10601024). MGA contains a second DNA-binding domain, known as the T-domain, that binds to genes containing Brachyury-binding sites. In vitro studies demonstrated that MGA can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor, and transcriptional activation is dependent on MAX (PMID: 10601024).

MGAM (also MGA) is a glucosidase that regulates the digestion of starch to glucose (PMID: 17592362). MGAM and a second glucosidase, sucrose isomaltase (SI), are responsible for the last enzymatic step that results in the release of glucose during starch digestion (PMID: 18036614, 21924903). Starch digestion initially involves breakdown by Î±-amylases into small malto-oligosaccharides, which then are hydrolyzed by glucosidases (PMID: 22851177, 23838818). The main enzymatic activity of MGAM is to hydrolyze short, linear alpha-1,4-oligosaccharides, resulting in the production of glucose to the lumen (PMID: 20356844, 22058037). Dietary restriction alters chromatin modifications at the MGAM promoter, suggesting that gene expression is regulated by diet (PMID: 22819554). MGAM expression is localized to gastric tissues and is predominantly found anchored to the brush border membrane of the intestinal mucosa (PMID: 3143729, 18036614). Loss of MGAM expression in mice results in the inability to increase intestinal alpha-glucosidic activities in response to a starch-based diet, implicating MGAM in glucose homeostasis (PMID: 19193815). Somatic mutations in MGAM are rare; however, overexpression and amplification of MGAM have been found in several tumor types including gastric and oral cancers, among others (PMID: 17611641, 23405089).

MLH1 functions to correct mismatched nucleotides and insertion/deletion loops that are erroneously incorporated into the newly synthesized strand of DNA during replication, using the parental strand of DNA as a template. As part of this pathway, MLH1 heterodimerizes with PMS2 (most commonly), PMS1 or MLH3 to form an endonuclease complex that incises the damaged strand, leading to its local excision (PMID: 10037723, 10542278, 10615123). Mutations in MLH1 lead to an inability to correctly repair mismatches and insertion/deletion loops, which are most frequently associated with microsatellite repeat sequences. Tumors with inactivating MLH1 mutations are likely to exhibit a microsatellite instability-high phenotype (PMID: 9823339, 12454837).

Inactivating mutations of MLH3 have been identified in various types of cancer, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 18521850, 16885347, 18551179).	true

MLLT1 (also ENL) is a transcriptional adaptor protein that is a member of the eleven-nineteen leukemia (ENL) family (PMID: 17855633, 20153263, 28241139). MLLT1 associates with the super elongation transcription complex composed of p-TEFb (Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b), a protein complex implicated in the phosphorylation of RNA pol II (PMID: 20153263), and other KMT2A-associated adaptor proteins involved in transactivation (PMID: 17855633). The super elongation complex targets KMT2A, a hematopoietic transcriptional coactivator, to hematopoietic genes to initiate transcription (PMID: 20153263). MLLT1 interacts with a variety of proteins involved in chromatin regulation, such as the histone H3 K79 methyltransferase DOT1L, and other KMT2A-related adaptor proteins (PMID: 17855633, 17957188, 15856011). Activating mutations in MLLT1 have been identified in patients with Wilm's tumor and these alterations impact the binding of MLLT1 to histone tails (PMID: 26635203). MLLT1 is the third most common fusion partner of KMT2A, a commonly rearranged gene in hematopoietic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 23628958). Mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells engineered to express MLLT1 fusion proteins exhibit altered hematopoietic lineage identity, clonal expansion and transformation in functional assays (PMID: 28572162, 28572162, 17957188, 28068328). MLLT1-rearranged proteins are aberrantly targeted to KMT2A target genes, leading to activation of gene expression programs that promote transformation (PMID: 20153263, 27050521). DOT1L inhibitors or therapeutics targeting transcriptional elongation, such as BRD4 inhibitors, may be efficacious in patients with MLLT1 rearrangements (PMID: 31157223).	false

MLLT10 (also AF10) is a histone methyltransferase cofactor that is a member of the MLL family of PHD finger proteins (PMID: 7888665). MLLT10 regulates the methylation of H3K79 on histone H3, a histone mark that is predominantly found within gene bodies (PMID: 21724828). Histone proteins are an essential component of the nucleosome, which consists of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones) and histone methylation results in the activation or repression of gene expression in different contexts (PMID: 11498575). Methylation of H3K79 has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including DNA repair, cellular differentiation, splicing, cell cycle, and regulation of transcription, among others (PMID: 27234562). Binding of MLLT10 to chromatin, in collaboration with the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, mediates the conversion of H3K79me1 to H3K79me2, which serves as a signal for gene expression changes important in several differentiation programs including at the HOXA locus (PMID: 25464900, 21724828). Reduced expression of MLLT10 results in weakened transforming ability in hematopoietic assays, suggesting that MLLT10 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 25464900). Recurrent fusion proteins containing MLLT10 have been identified in patients with hematopoietic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia and T-ALL (PMID: 23673860, 28242784, 23673860). MLLT10-rearrangements are predicted to bind chromatin and activate DOT1L H3K79-methyltransferase activity (PMID: 28242784, 15851025). Hematopoietic malignancies with aberrant MLLT10 activity may be sensitive to DOT1L inhibitors, as demonstrated in functional assays (PMID: 25464900).	false

MLLT3, or A9, is a subunit of the super elongation complex, which plays a key role in the regulation of the transcriptional elongation checkpoint of transcription (PMID: 20159561). MLLT3 is a key regulator of the self-renewal of human hematopoietic stem cells through the maintenance of their transcriptional program (PMID: 31776511). In coordination with the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, MLLT3 localizes to active transcription start sites through its YEATS domain (PMID: 31776511). The YEATS domain of MLLT3 recognizes crotonylated histone H3 and links crotonylation to active transcription (PMID: 27105114). Knocked-down expression of MLLT3 in cell lines results in suppressed cell proliferation and JNK signaling (PMID: 31966817). MLLT3 rearrangements that result in truncation and loss of the YEATS domain promote tumorigenesis through aberrant gene transcription (PMID: 31776511). MLLT3 fusion proteins have been identified in a variety of tumor types including osteosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 31966817, 20844554). MLLT3 rearrangements may be sensitive to DOT1L inhibitors, as demonstrated in functional assays (PMID: 25464900).	false

MOB3B (also MOBKL2B) is a kinase activator that shares homology with the MOB family of proteins (PMID: 28792927). While the function of MOB3B is unknown, MOB3B is a paralog of MOB1A/B, components of the Hippo signaling pathway (PMID: 28792927). MOB proteins bind activated Hippo, resulting in the recruitment and activation of the signaling factor LATS (PMID: 30183404). The MOB-LATS complex recruits additional signaling proteins and controls the activity of the downstream transcription factors YAP and TAZ (PMID: 30183404). In addition, MOB proteins have been implicated in the regulation of mitotic checkpoint regulation, cellular proliferation and spindle pole body duplication (PMID: 18328423, 9436989). Deletions in MOB3B are found in patients with mantle cell lymphoma and these alterations are associated with poorer patient outcome (PMID: 20421449, 18984860). In addition, MOB3B overexpression has been implicated in resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors vemurafenib and cetuximab (PMID: 28792927, 29802456), likely due to altered Hippo signaling (PMID: 28792927).	true

MPEG1 (also Perforin-2) is a pore forming protein that perforates target cell membranes or bacterial envelopes (PMID: 27857713, 7888681, 23257510). MPEG1 is a membrane protein that is most highly expressed in macrophages and is involved in the host defense against intracellular and extracellular bacteria (PMID: 7888681, 25717326, 28705375). Pore-forming proteins, such as MPEG1, homopolymerize resulting in a hollow hydrophobic cylinder that allows for insertion into the membrane or bacterial cell walls (PMID: 27857713, 20860583). Following the MPEG1-mediated immune attack, pore clusters render bacteria susceptible to secondary attack by antimicrobial effectors including reactive oxygen species, the lysozyme and proteases (PMID: 26402460, 26402460). MPEG1 is a largely unspecific effector in innate immunity and is conserved across multicellular organisms (PMID: 26307549). The unspecific mechanism of MPEG1 allows for the clearance of Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and acid-fast bacteria (PMID: 27857713). Expression of MPEG1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in the ability to clear bacteria from the culture, unlike wildtype cells (PMID: 23257510). Loss of MPEG1 expression in model organisms results in an abnormal immune response and the inability to effectively combat bacterial infection (PMID: 25247677, 28422754, 30249808, 26831467). Mutations in MPEG1 are found in patients with persistent nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and immune cells isolated from these patients are unable to kill bacteria in functional assays (PMID: 28422754). Somatic mutations in MPEG1 are infrequent in human cancers.	false

MPL encodes for the myeloproliferative leukemia proto-oncogene, thrombopoietin receptor. The gene was first identified in as the oncogene v-mpl, from the murine myeloproliferative leukemia virus that transformed hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow in mice (PMID: 7836743). The normal receptor protein is critical in growth and regulation of megakaryocytes and platelet production (PMID: 8202154). The gene is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular cytokine binding domain and intracellular cytokine signaling domains. Binding of its ligand, thrombopoietin (TPO), results in receptor dimerization and activation of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases; this leads to activation of the STAT family of transcription factors (PMID: 7796811). The MAPK pathway can also be activated as a result of receptor activation (PMID: 10438715). The most common mutations, W515L and W515K, which activate receptor signaling are found in myeloproliferative neoplasms such as essential thrombocytosis and myelofibrosis (PMID: 16834459). Aberrant expression of MPL has been reported in some solid tumors. In a study of 128 colorectal cancer cases, higher MPL expression was associated with metastasis to liver and lung (PMID:23747337). However, in a study of 118 breast tumors and 29 lung tumors, MPL mRNA was either not detectable or at very low levels (PMID: 22967017). The thromobopoietin receptor can be activated by administration of drug agonists such as eltrombopag and romiplostim. These therapies have been approved for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (PMID:18046028,7050891).	false

Germline mutations of MRE11 are associated with ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder and predispose to breast and ovarian cancers.	MRE11 is a member of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs (MRN) complex involved in sensing and repairing DNA double strand breaks (PMID:10523656, 11430828). The complex activates the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related) to initiate DNA damage responses and is itself phosphorylated by ATM (PMID: 23525106, 23582259, 26512707). MRE11 has DNA nuclease activity important for stimulating repair (PMID:18854157). Activation of the MRN complex enables the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA damage (PMID:14657032). The complex is also important for genomic integrity at telomeres, replication forks, immunoglobulin gene loci during rearrangements, and DNA breaks formed in meiosis (PMID:19667071, 21565612, 16285919, 17291760). Activation of repair mechanisms include non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair (PMID:12422221, 24316220). Mutations in MRE11 are associated with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, resulting in chromosomal instability and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (PMID:10612394). MRE11 is also a familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene and mutations have also been identified in endometrial, colorectal, and lymphoid cancers (PMID:19383352, 24549055, 24894818, 23755103, 11196167, 11850399, 16959974). MRE11 polymorphisms and mutations affect response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors (PMID:24623370, 25310185, 24927325, 24215868, 25324139, 24240112).	true

MS4A1, which encodes the B-cell surface marker CD20, is a member of the MS4A (membrane-spanning 4-domains family, subfamily A) family that is comprised of proteins that span the cellular membrane four times (PMID: 25835430, 35091527). MS4A1 functions in B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation (PMID: 33352466, 35091527). MS4A1 can associate with a variety of membrane proteins, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, MHC class II, tetraspanins (CD53, CD81, and CD82), and CD40; however the exact nature of these associations are still unknown (PMID: 25835430, 32482755). MS4A1 is involved in calcium conductance, as it functions as a store-operated calcium (SOC) channel that promotes calcium influx through physical association with the B-cell receptor (BCR) (PMID: 25835430). MS4A1 is required for optimal humoral immunity, as MS4A1 deficiency in both humans and mice results in impaired immune responses (PMID: 25835430, 32482755). In colorectal cancer, MS4A1 is significantly downregulated and CD20 expression is positively correlated with the patient survival rate (PMID: 33352466). In ovarian cancer, CD20-positive T-cells were shown to be elevated in ascites fluid of patients and were associated with a positive prognosis, as these cells mediate antitumor immunity (PMID: 26137418, 34654826). In breast cancer, patients who demonstrated higher MS4A1 expression also had a better prognosis (PMID: 35091527). CD20 expression is a clinically useful biomarker for B-cell targeted monoclonal antibody therapies, including rituximab, ofatumumab and obinutuzumab (PMID: 34654826, 25835430, 32482755).	false

Select mutations of MSH2 are associated with Lynch syndrome and can lead to genomic instability in tumors.	The MSH2 (MutS protein homolog 2) protein is a tumor suppressor involved in the mismatch repair process. MSH2 forms heterodimers with other MutS proteins, MSH6 and MSH3, to form the MutS-alpha and MutS-beta mismatch repair (MMR) complexes, respectively (PMID: 8252616, 7973733). Both complexes are involved in the recognition of a mismatched base pair, forming a DNA-MutS complex that signals other components of the MMR machinery to excise the aberrant nucleotide. MSH2 and other MMR genes are most notably implicated in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome (PMID: 428275, 1648437). Loss of function mutations or epigenetic silencing both in the germline and somatic context lead to an increased mutation rate that drives carcinogenesis as well as microsatellite instability (MSI). MSH2 mutations represent approximately 40% of all HNPCC cases (PMID: 11852992) and are associated with the MSI-high phenotype, along with mutations in MLH1 (PMID: 9823339, 9354436). Although most commonly seen in colon cancer, MSH2 mutations have also been reported in a diverse range of other cancer types and syndromes, including endometrial and uterine cancers, and sebaceous gland tumors (PMID: 19078925,16826164). Tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects have been predictive of clinical benefit to certain immune checkpoint blockade therapies (PMID:26028255, 25409260). Recently, the FDA approved pembrolizumab (PD-1 blockade) for all mismatch repair deficient and microsatellite unstable (MSI-high) tumors, irrespective of specific tumor etiology.	true

MSH3 encodes the protein MutS Homolog 3 (MSH3) ,the human homolog of the bacterial MutS protein, which functions in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway of DNA repair. MSH3 partners with MSH2 to form the heterodimer MutS-beta, which is important for recognition and repair of mismatched base pairs, forming a DNA-MutS complex which signals other components of the MMR machinery to excise the aberrant nucleotide (PMID: 22179786, 8942985, 9679053). MSH3 deletion or loss-of-function mutations can result in MMR deficiency, leading to an increased mutation rate and increased tumorigenesis in cooperation with loss of MSH6 (PMID: 10706084). MSH3 is altered in nearly 50% of MMR-deficient colorectal cancers by somatic frameshift mutations (PMID: 23724141,18922920,14871813, 9331106).

MSI1 (Musashi1) is an RNA-binding protein which binds to the consensus RNA sequence GU3-5(G/AG) on specific mRNAs and controls their expression by translational repression (PMID: 22201732). The Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins is known to be important for cell fate determination, neural development and maintenance of stem-cell state, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Musashi1 is selectively expressed in neural progenitor cells, including neural stem cells (PMID: 9790759). Musashi1, in cooperation with Musashi2, activates Notch signaling through translational repression of Numb mRNA, an intracellular Notch signal repressor, and maintains the self-renewing ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) (PMID: 15925591). Musashi1 also activates the WNT pathway and serves to sustain mammary gland stem cell pools (PMID: 18362162). In addition, Musashi1 is a selective marker for intestinal stem or early lineage cells (PMID: 12924647, 15925591).

MSI2 (Musashi2) is an RNA-binding protein which binds to the consensus RNA sequences on specific mRNAs and controls their expression in part by translational repression (PMID: 28143872). The Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins is known to be important for cell fate determination, neural development and maintenance of stem-cell state, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Musashi2, like Musashi1, activates Notch signaling through translational repression of Numb mRNA, an intracellular Notch signal repressor, and maintains the self-renewing ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) (PMID: 15925591). In addition, Musashi2 expression is required for self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells in early stages of differentiation (PMID: 22496868). Musashi2 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is important in the maintenance of the stem cell compartment and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (PMID: 21613258). Overexpression of Musashi2 in mouse models cooperates with the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein to drive aggressive leukemia (PMID: 20616797).

MST1 (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) is an intracellular kinase and key component of the Hippo signaling pathway. The Hippo signaling cascade is a critical regulator for controlling cell growth, differentiation and organ size control (PMID: 22683405, 22898666). MST1 is proteolyticaly activated by caspases during apoptosis; activation is mediated by apoptotic stimuli and other stress signals. Full activation of MST1 kinase requires autophosphorylation at Thr-183 and caspase-mediated cleavage. Once activated, MST1 phosphorylates Lats1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1/2), which then phosphorylates and inhibits two transcriptional coactivators in the Hippo pathway, YAP and TAZ (PMID:17889654). Phosphorylated YAP and TAZ remain in the cytoplasm and cannot induce the expression of genes that promote cell growth and proliferation (PMID: 17889654). Hence, MST1 negatively regulates YAP and TAZ and acts as a tumor suppressor. Reduced expression of MST1 has been observed in gastric cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer and soft tissue sarcoma (PMID: 21940329, 17538946, 18381433).	true

MST1R (Macrophage Stimulating 1 Receptor) is a cell surface receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP). The MST1R protein is one of two members of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase family, along with parent receptor MET. Activation of MST1R triggers downstream signaling cascades, including RAS, PI3-kinase (PI3-K), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) to induce cell scattering, migration, survival and invasion (PMID: 12807733,18836480, 25997828). MST1R is expressed in various cell types including macrophages, epithelial and hematopoietic cells. MST1R is overexpressed in pancreatic and epithelial cancers of the breast, colon, lung, and prostate (PMID: 22834780, 17616662, 17311308, 26477314, 15289319), and is involved in tumor progression and metastasis (PMID: 15289319, 10910951, 19956854). MST1R is rarely mutated, but alternative splicing events are common as the gene transcript is increasingly overexpressed. Approximately eight different MST1R isoforms have been described in various epithelial cancer types (PMID: 23792360). In breast cancer, short-form MST1R overexpression specifically activates the PI3K signaling pathway, resulting in increased tumor growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis (PMID: 22207901). In prostate cancer cells, MST1R has been shown to regulate angiogenic chemokine production (PMID: 19838218). Additionally, one study using gastroesophageal carcinoma (GEC) samples reported increased MST1R gene copy number in 35.5% (16/45) of cases and a novel somatic MST1R juxtamembrane mutation (R1018G) in 11% of samples, making MST1R an important prognostic marker in this GEC cohort (PMID: 21543897).	false

MTAP is a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase that is a regulator of polyamine metabolism (PMID: 27068473, 26912360). MTAP metabolizes 2-methylthiosdenosine (MTA), a byproduct of polyamine synthesis, for the salvage of methionine amino acids and adenine nucleotides (PMID: 21301207). Loss of MTAP results in increased sensitivity to purine starvation and has been linked to regulation of stemness, apoptosis, and inflammation (PMID: 31040154, 30854099). The MTAP gene resides within the 9p21 chromosomal region, which is deleted in 15% of all cancers (PMID: 27068473). The 9p21 region includes the tumor suppressors CDKN2A, p16-INK4A, and p19-ARF; MTAP co-deletion with these genes occurs in a majority of 9p21 deletions (PMID: 27068473, 26912360). Deletion of MTAP in cancer cell lines results in the accumulation of MTA, a metabolic inhibitor of the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, due to reduced MTAP-mediated byproduct cleavage (PMID: 27068473, 26912360). PRMT5 activity and expression of PRMT5 binding partners are downregulated in MTAP-deleted cancer cells, including RIOK1 and WDR77 (PMID: 27068473, 26912360). Functional studies demonstrated that MTAP-deleted cancer cell lines have an increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibitors, and PRMT5 inhibitors may be an efficacious therapeutic strategy in 9p21-deleted cancers (PMID: 27068473, 26912360, 31257072). In addition, MAT2A, a methionine adenosyltransferase that produces a byproduct that also inhibits PRMT5, was identified as an additional vulnerability in MTAP-deleted cancers (PMID: 27068473).	true

The MTOR protein is a serine-threonine kinase that coordinates cell growth, protein synthesis and metabolic signaling (PMID: 22500797, 21157483). MTOR activity is mediated through two distinct multi-protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (PMID: 22500797, 21157483) which are composed of common subunits (mTOR, mLST8, DEPTOR) (PMID: 12718876, 19446321) and uniquely defined by specific subunits. mTORC1 is defined by the PRAS40 and RAPTOR subunits (PMID: 12150926, 12150925, 17386266, 17510057), while mTORC2 is defined by RICTOR, mSIN1 and PROTOR1/2 (PMID: 15268862, 15718470, 16919458). The two best characterized downstream targets of mTORC1, S6K and 4EBP1, dictate the rate of protein synthesis, nutrient response and many additional features required for rapid tumor growth (PMID: 15314020). Consequently, inhibition of mTORC1 has been therapeutically exploited across a variety of malignancies. mTORC2 coordinates with PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate AKT. mTORC2 is known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle progression and cellular survival (PMID: 18566586). Missense mutations of the MTOR gene occur in many tumors, notably in approximately 6% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, 7.5% of lung adenocarcinomas, 5% of endometrial carcinomas and 4% of colon and rectal carcinomas (PMID: 24132290). Furthermore, various mTOR mutations have been characterized that cause increased MTOR pathway activation and increased sensitivity to rapamycin (PMID: 24631838, 24625776). Several case reports in the literature have reported extreme durable responses to rapamycin-analogue (rapalogue) therapies in patients with heavily pre-treated metastatic cancer and activating mTOR mutations (PMID: 24622468, 24625776). Additionally, two rapalogue mTOR inhibitors, everolimus and temsirolimus, are FDA-approved for the treatment of human cancer, and numerous compounds with alternative mechanisms of action are in various stages of development (PMID: 26299952).	false

Germline mutations of MUTYH are associated with MUTYH-associated Polyposis syndrome.	MUTYH is a DNA glycosylase that mediates base excision repair. MUTYH can repair DNA lesions in which oxidized guanine is mispaired with adenine due to oxidative damage (PMID: 23507534, 1495996). Repair of these lesions prevents GC to TA transversions (PMID: 17581577). Germline mutations in MUTYH lead to colorectal polyposis and adenomas that are inherited in a recessive fashion and an increased risk of gliomas and breast cancer (PMID:12606733, 26902849, 26824983, 26296701). MUTYH alterations result in increased TA transversions in colon cancer patients, suggesting that these are loss-of-function alterations (PMID: 12393807). Somatic allelic loss and rare mutations of MUTYH have been identified in colon cancer, however, these alterations did not lead to increased transversions (PMID:22641385). Further functional studies are required to determine if somatic MUTYH mutations are drivers of human cancer.	true

MYB encodes for a transcription factor that functions primarily in fetal hematopoiesis and lymphocyte development (PMID: 10323859, 16169500, 19843942). MYB can function as both a transcriptional repressor and transcriptional activator for genes essential to cellular proliferation, such as RUNX1 and CEBPB, and can either suppress differentiation or promote cellular proliferation (PMID: 21317192). The C-terminal region of MYB contains a negative regulatory domain and mutations or deletion of this region can promote cellular transformation (PMID: 2670562). Ectopic expression of MYB in various types of cancer cell lines and models induces cellular growth and increased cell survival, suggesting that MYB functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 21948968, 11290547). Amplification and rearrangements of MYB have been identified in various types of cancer, such as breast cancer, acute myelogenous leukemia and salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (PMID: 11034064, 3281804, 25963073).	false

MYBL1 is a transcription factor that regulates spermatogenesis in the pachynema stage of male-specific meiosis. The conserved N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and the trans-activating domain located at the central portion of the protein allow for binding to specific DNA sequences and subsequent meiotic gene transcription, respectively (PMID: 8058310). The conserved C-terminal negative regulatory domain regulates the expression of MYBL1 (PMID: 33637673). MYBL1 serves as the master regulator of meiotic genes involved in multiple meiotic processes such as DNA double-strand break repair, synapsis, crossing over, pachynema cell cycle progression and postmeiotic transcription (PMID: 21750041). Alterations of MYBL1 have been identified to truncate the C-terminal negative regulatory domain, leading to the activation of MYBL1 (PMID: 33637673). Overexpression of MYBL1 promotes tumorigenesis due to aberrant meiotic gene transcription causing angiogenesis (PMID: 35987690). MYBL1 alterations have been identified in a variety of tumor types including adenoid cystic carcinoma, low-grade glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 26631609, 29410490, 33637673, 32637581, 35987690).	false

"MYC is a transcription factor in the MYC family of proteins (c-MYC, n-MYC and l-MYC) that heterodimerizes with the protein MAX to control the transcription of thousands of genes. MYC promotes tumorigenesis by inducing cell proliferation, inhibiting exit from the cell cycle, stimulating vascularization and enhancing genomic instability (PMID: 22464321,10378696,16934487,19029958). The MYC gene contains several distinct structural domains, including five ""Myc-boxes"", which are highly conserved in MYC family proteins across multiple species (PMID: 19029958). Mutations of known function reside near residue T58, which is a phosphorylation site on MYC critical for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the MYC protein (PMID: 10706881, 22464321). Mutations in the MYC gene occur but are less frequent than amplification and translocation."	false

MYCL is a transcription factor and member of the MYC oncoprotein family (PMID: 3322939). The architecture of the MYCL gene shows substantial homology with the other members of the human MYC gene family (MYC and MYCN) (PMID:10378696). Unlike MYC, which is expressed ubiquitously, MYCL is preferentially expressed in the developing kidney and lung (PMID: 8657155), and appears to be less potent in terms of transformation potential (PMID: 2457153). Reports of cancer-associated genomic alterations of MYCL are predominantly limited to small cell lung carcinomas, where MYCL is found amplified in approximately 5-10% of samples (PMID: 2997622,1327035). Amplification of other MYC family members also occurs in small cell lung cancer, and in some cases these amplifications may co-occur with amplifications of MYCL (PMID:10378696,1327035).	false

MYCN is a MYC-family transcription factor with high homology to the commonly amplified transcription factor c-MYC (encoded by the gene MYC) (PMID: 20399964). MYCN has been shown to function both as a transcriptional activator and repressor, regulating the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism and regulation of the tumor microenvironment, among other processes (PMID: 16934487, 20399964). The MYCN gene is organized into an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminal basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper DNA-binding domain. Unlike c-MYC, which is ubiquitously expressed, expression of n-MYC is temporally restricted to embryonic development and spatially restricted to cells of the nervous system, kidney, lung and spleen. Amplification of MYCN is predominantly associated with cancers of neural origin (e.g. neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma), but has been observed in other solid tumors including prostate, breast and small cell lung cancers (PMID: 24589438, 16934487,15013217). Targeting MYCN directly has been challenging, and therefore therapeutic strategies have focused on targeting MYCN downstream targets, factors involved in MYCN transcriptional activity or MYCN stability (PMID: 24857145, 24086065).	false

MYD88 encodes for the signaling adaptor protein Myeloid differentiation primary response 88. It functions to transduce signaling from Toll-like receptors and the Interleukin-1 receptor important for innate immunity (PMID: 16413925, 12467250, 11544529). Signaling through MYD88 activates the NFkB pathway (PMID: 9734363). Patients with MYD88 loss of function mutations are more susceptible to bacterial infections due to immune dysfunction (PMID:18669862). Activating mutations of MYD88, particularly the L265P mutation, are frequently identified in WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia patients (PMID: 22931316). The same mutation is also found in lymphomas, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the Activated B-cell type Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) (PMID: 21179087, 22150006).	false

MYH11 is a smooth muscle myosin protein belonging to the myosin heavy chain family (PMID: 32382337).  MYH11 functions as a contractile protein involved in inducing muscle contraction via ATP hydrolysis, but may also be able to regulate gene expression patterns of the cell by binding DNA as a transcription factor (PMID: 34380460). Pathogenic germline alterations in MYH11 predispose to familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection (TAAD), and individuals with these mutations show smooth muscle cell disarray and hyperplasia (PMID: 17666408). Meanwhile, in vitro overexpression of MYH11 inhibits cell migration, proliferation and invasion suggesting it acts as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 34380460). Inversion of chromosome 16 can result in the CBFB-MYH11 fusion, which is found in the M4 type of acute myeloid leukemia with associated eosinophilia (PMID: 23160462). This fusion protein disrupts the CBF complex and results in a block in proper hematopoiesis (PMID: 20007544).	true

MYOD1 is a transcription factor that is a member of the bHLH protein family. MYOD1, together with the closely related regulatory transcription factors MYF5, MRF4 and MYOGENIN, control myogenic differentiation. MYOD1 commits mesoderm cells to a skeletal myoblast lineage, regulates their continued state and can also regulate muscle repair (PMID:16099183). MYOD1 removes cells from the cell cycle by increasing the transcription of p21 and myogenin, which is important for the switch from cellular proliferation to differentiation. Loss of this control can lead to the formation of rhabdomyosarcoma (PMID:16099183, 12783965).

NADK is a kinase involved in the regulation of several metabolic and biosynthetic pathways (PMID: 27582489, 21526340, 17855339). NADK is localized to the cytoplasm and catalyzes the phosphorylation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADP+ (PMID 27582489, 21526340, 17855339). NADK-dependent phosphorylation requires ATP and magnesium cofactors for this conversion (PMID: 21526340, 17855339). NADP+ is then reduced to NADPH by dehydrogenases, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzymes (PMID: 27582489, 21526340). NADPH is an important cofactor involved in several protein, nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis pathways (PMID: 27582489). Proliferating cancer cells are increasingly dependent on these biosynthetic pathways during growth (PMID: 27582489). In addition, NADPH is necessary for maintenance of the cellular redox state and neutralizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cancer cell proliferation (PMID: 22550069, 18020963). Additional roles of NADPH include antioxidant host defense and regulation of glucose-mediated insulin secretion (PMID: 22550069). Somatic gain-of-function mutations in NADK have been identified in patients with pancreatic and colorectal cancer (PMID: 28954733, 26806015). Overexpression of NADK has also been found in patients with various cancers, suggesting that NADK may predominantly function as an oncogene (PMID: 27582489). Suppression of the NADPH pool has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy in cancer patients (PMID: 26219913).	false

Germline mutations of NBN are associated with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and a predisposition to cancer.	NBN is a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs (MRN) complex involved in DNA double-strand break sensing and repair (PMID: 9590181). The complex activates the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related) to initiate DNA damage response and is itself phosphorylated by ATM (PMID: 23525106, 23582259, 26512707, 10802669). The complex has DNA nuclease activity important for stimulating repair (PMID: 18854157). Activation of the MRN complex enables the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint response to DNA damage (PMID: 14657032). The complex is also important for genomic integrity at telomeres, replication forks, immunoglobulin gene loci during rearrangements and DNA breaks formed in meiosis (PMID: 19667071, 21565612, 16285919, 17291760). Activation of repair mechanisms includes non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair (PMID: 12422221, 24316220). Germline NBN mutations are associated with the Nijmegen breakage syndrome, characterized by increased cancer incidence, microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency and sensitivity to ionizing radiation (PMID: 9590180, 9590181). Mutations have been found in cholangiocarcinoma, liver, prostate cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, medulloblastoma and other cancers (PMID: 24349281, 22864661, 21923652, 18593981,18056440). Mutations and copy number alterations in NBN may lead to susceptibility to radiation and specific inhibitors related to DNA damage including Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors (PMID: 22396666, 25324139, 25415046, 24240112).	true

NCOA3 (also known as pCIP, SRC3) is a nuclear receptor co-activator involved in the regulation of transcription. It interacts with nuclear hormone receptors to enhance transcription (PMID:23850489, 15383283). NCOA3 has histone acetyltransferase activity and can recruit other histone acetyltransferase enzymes to the complex (PMID:9296499, 9192892). It acts to regulate pluripotency in stem cells, mammary gland development and response to TNF alpha (PMID: 10823921, 23019124, 15383283). It is expressed in various cancer cells and affects processes including cancer metabolism, anti-apoptosis, and cell growth (PMID:24584933, 23388826, 20663904). Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in various tumor types including gastric and non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 25970779, 20064830). The gene has been found to be amplified in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer (PMID:9252329, 22371647).

NCOR1 is a nuclear transcriptional co-repressor that represses transcription mainly by recruiting histone deacetylase HDAC3 to DNA promoter regions (PMID: 20084085). Physiologically, NCOR1 is involved in the control of metabolism and inflammation as well as embryonal development (PMID: 20084085). NCOR1 is involved in the regulation of S-phase progression and genomic stability. It does so by maintaining acetylation and methylation patterns during S phase, which are essential for DNA repair and genomic stability (PMID: 21075309). NCOR1 has previously been linked to several kinds of cancers such as leukemia, glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal as well as endometrial carcinoma and prostate cancer (PMID: 17190815, 17630505, 17694085, 17312396, 19414341, 19269830, 12441355, 16373395, 22695118). Some leukemias are caused by translocation events that pair co-repressor-interacting proteins with proteins that are not regulated by NCOR1. This results in aberrant gene repression, which in some cases can be overcome by HDAC inhibitors (PMID: 9462740). NCOR is dramatically increased in glioblastoma multiforme, which correlates with de-differentiated phenotype and progression of the tumors (PMID: 16479164, 16534112). In these cases, preclinical evidence has shown that inhibition of the NCOR1 pathway can be achieved by simultaneous administration of Retinoic Acid and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitors which led to dramatic increase in differentiation and inhibition (PMID: 17312396).	true

NCOR2 (also SMRT) is a nuclear hormone transcriptional co-repressor that is a member of the NCOR protein family (PMID: 20084085). NCOR2 represses transcription mainly by recruiting the histone deacetylase HDAC3 to DNA promoter regions (PMID: 20084085, 11509652). Histone deacetylases predominantly function to add repressive marks to chromatin, resulting in chromatin compaction and reduced gene expression (PMID: 17694085). NCOR2 is homologous to NCOR1 and both corepressors bind similar substrates, namely the HDAC3 complex, which includes TBL1, TBLR1 and GPS2 (PMID: 20084085). In addition, NCOR2 associates with additional DNA binding proteins that regulate actin binding, kinase inhibition, histone binding and scaffolding, p53-dependent DNA damage and ubiquitination (PMID: 20084085). While NCOR1 and NCOR2 have some overlapping functions, non-redundant upstream kinases regulate their activation and differential expression patterns contribute to their context-specificity (PMID: 15491994, 17928865). In addition, NCOR2 preferentially regulates the activity of the retinoic acid receptor (PMID: 11435607). In addition, NCOR2 has been implicated in the regulation of neural stem cell proliferation, lineage commitment, metabolism, and inflammation (PMID: 19066220). Somatic mutations in NCOR2 are rare; however, aberrant NCOR2 activity is predicted to aberrantly regulate histone deacetylation and gene repression in human cancers (PMID: 17694085). In leukemias, NCOR2 mediates the binding of fusion proteins to DNA, such as PML/RARÎ±, to coordinate gene regulation (PMID: 15729358). Additional mutations in NCOR2 binding partners lead to abnormal NCOR2/HDAC3 activity in cancers; however, NCOR2 mutations have not been extensively characterized (PMID: 27733359).	false

NCSTN is a protease that serves as an essential component of the gamma-secretase complex (PMID: 25565961). NCSTN catalyzes the cleavage of membrane proteins, including Notch receptors 1-4, in order to release a processed intracellular NOTCH domain that can then activate gene expression in the nucleus (PMID: 22547652). The NOTCH signaling pathway regulates various aspects of cell differentiation, growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism (PMID: 27507209). Deletion of NCSTN in the hematopoietic system in murine models results in increased numbers of thymic dendritic cells and T regulatory cells, implicating NCSTN in immune homeostasis (PMID: 22547652). In addition, NCSTN functions as a protease in other contexts, including in the cleavage of APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) into amyloid-beta peptides, which compose plaques in the brains of Alzheimerâs patients (PMID: 12297508). Germline and somatic NCSTN alterations have been identified in patients with Alzheimerâs disease as well as in dermatological disorders (PMID: 11992262, 12419494, 25211177, 26224166). Somatic mutations in NCSTN are rare in human cancers; however, amplifications in NCSTN may lead to increased NOTCH signaling (PMID: 26109346, cbioportal accessed August 2018).

NEGR1 is a cell adhesion protein that is primarily localized to cell membrane rafts, especially in regions of cell-to-cell contact. NEGR1 is extracellularly tethered to the membrane using a specialized lipid moiety termed a GPI-anchor. NEGR1 and other GPI-anchored proteins are highly enriched in lipid raft domains and are involved in a number of important cellular activities including signaling processes and cell adhesion (PMID: 12440695). Genetic alterations of NEGR1 have been implicated in human obesity and dyslexia (PMID: 19079261). NEGR1 is downregulated in several cancers types (PMID: 21624008) and reintroduction of NEGR1 into a human cancer cell line results in reduced cell proliferation (PMID: 21624008, 25057311). These data suggest that NEGR1 functions as a putative tumor suppressor, however, pro-tumorigenic roles have been assigned to NEGR1 in the maintenance of tumorigenic activity in metastatic breast cancer cells (PMID: 24648515). In addition, a study aimed at identifying protein biomarkers in urine for early detection of invasive breast cancer found NEGR1 as a protein that was significantly upregulated in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared to the normal control subjects (PMID: 26544852).	false

When bound to RAS, the NF1 protein stabilizes the GTPase activity of the RAS proteins, which switches RAS from its active, GTP-bound state to its inactive, GDP-bound state (PMID: 9219684, 9302992). The GAP-related domain (GRD) is the catalytic domain of NF1, which is directly responsible for its GAP activity but only encompasses approximately 10% of the protein. NF1 is congenitally altered in the cancer-predisposing syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and is somatically altered in many tumor types including breast cancer, melanoma, and glioma (PMID: 2134734, 1946382, 18772890, 23000897, 9639526, 18948947, 22817889). Inactivation of NF1 due to gene deletion, gene mutation, or protein degradation results in elevated levels of active, GTP-bound RAS and activation of downstream pathways such as the MAPK/ERK pathway and the PI3K pathway (PMID: 19573811, 24576830, 8563751, 7542586, 8052307, 12509763). Missense and truncating mutations occur across the entire gene and do not localize to hotspots. Alterations occurring on one allele of NF1 likely lead to haploinsufficiency of the protein (PMID: 7920653,18089636) as many patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 have an unaltered second allele despite exhibiting symptoms of the syndrome. Additionally, functional loss of heterozygosity likely occurs on the second NF1 allele, as tumors with NF1 point mutations have lower levels of mRNA than wildtype tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, May 2015).	true

Germline mutations of NF2 are associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 and predispose to certain cancers.	NF2, also known as Merlin, is a membrane-cytoskeleton scaffolding protein that is expressed predominantly in nervous tissues (PMID:25893302). NF2 is important in indirectly linking actin-transmembrane receptors and intracellular effectors to modulate signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and survival. These include downstream signaling pathways of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), cell adhesion, small GTPases, mTOR, PI3K/Akt and hippo pathways (PMID: 20491622). NF2 is a tumor suppressor. Germline inactivation of NF2 by mutation or deletion results in the autosomal dominant tumor syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 2, which is associated with the development of benign central nervous system (CNS) tumors such as vestibular schwannomas (PMID: 7911002). NF2 is found to be somatically mutated in other types of cancers.	true

NFE2 is a transcription factor that regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic gene expression (PMID: 11154691, 8469283). The NFE2 transcription factor complex consists of two subunits: p45, a hematopoietic-specific subunit and the smaller Maf protein subunit, which is more ubiquitously expressed (PMID: 11154691). NFE2, in collaboration with the chromatin regulatory protein CBP, binds erythroid and megakaryocytic promoters to regulate gene expression and epigenetic state (PMID: 11154691). In addition, NFE2 co-binds with the transcription factor AP-1 to modulate the expression of the erythroid globin genes (PMID: 12920035). NFE2 expression is regulated by JAK2 in myeloproliferative neoplasms, a malignancy that is dependent on JAK-STAT pathway activity (PMID: 29519804). Overexpression of NFE2 results in leukemic transformation in murine models, likely due to the upregulation of a chronic inflammatory response and subsequent clonal evolution (PMID: 23932394, 22231305). Somatic NFE2 mutations in human cancers are rare; however, NFE2 is overexpressed in myeloproliferative neoplasms and polycythemias (PMID: 16572198, 24297870). In addition, rare truncating gain-of-function mutations have been identified in myeloproliferative neoplasms (PMID: 23589569), suggesting the NFE2 predominantly functions as an oncogene.	false

NFE2L2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2), also known as NRF2, is a transcription factor that is important in activating antioxidant proteins to protect against certain environmental and oxidative stresses (PMID: 16968214). Under normal cellular conditions, the interaction of NRF2 with KEAP1 retains the protein in the cytoplasm and promotes its proteasomal degradation via ubiquitination (PMID: 9887101). Upon sensing stress signals, KEAP1 undergoes a conformational change, preventing it from interacting with NRF2 and allowing NRF2 to translocate to the nucleus and drive the expression of specific genes (PMID:12359864). NRF2 can have a protective role in cancer formation from certain chemical carcinogens (PMID: 11248092). However, chronic activation of NRF2 can also support the development of chemo- and radio-resistance (PMID: 24142871). Tumor-associated NRF2 activation can result from inactivation of KEAP1 through mutation, loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing (PMID: 19321346). NRF2 activation can also arise directly from mutations in NFE2L2 in the KEAP1-binding domains (PMID: 18757741, 19967722).	false

NFÎºBIÎ± (NF-ÎºB inhibitor Î±) is a protein that represses signaling of NF-ÎºB, a family of transcription factors activated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. NFÎºBIÎ± helps keep NFÎºB in an inactive state by supporting its interaction with inhibitory molecules in the cell cytoplasm. A range of external stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors or stress, can lead to phosphorylation of NFÎºBIÎ± and subsequently the release and nuclear translocation of NFÎºB; this results in the transcriptional activation of hundreds of genes that regulate the immune response, protect against apoptosis and signaling pathways critical to the formation of ectodermal tissues. Lack of NFÎºB is often due to loss-of-function mutations (small insertions, deletions, or missense) in one allele of NFÎºBIÎ± coupled with deletion or inactivation of the second allele (PMID: 9572494). Constitutive expression of NF-ÎºB signaling results in overexpression of several target genes encoding anti-apoptotic proteins and growth-promoting proteins (PMID: 11313274). Deletion of NFÎºBIA has demonstrated an effect similar to EGFR amplification in glioblastomas (GBM) and is associated with relatively reduced survival (PMID: 21175304). Further, enrichment of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations in NFÎºBIA have been observed in Hodgkinâs lymphoma (PMID: 10023670, 19507254), colorectal cancer (PMID: 17354114), melanoma (PMID: 17492467), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 19797428), breast cancer (PMID: 16959974) and multiple myeloma (PMID: 16540234).	true

NKX2-1 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor essential for the development of the lung, thyroid and ventral forebrain (PMID: 16405855). Expression of NKX2-1 is restricted to specific cell types in these lineages and NKX2-1 has a role in the regulation of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. In the lung, NKX2-1 is a critical regulator of the expression of surfactants, which are proteins important for reducing surface tension in the lung and play a critical role in host defense against infection and inflammation (PMID: 15173172). Thyroid precursor cells express NKX2-1 in order to regulate thyroid-specific genes and maintenance of NKX2-1 expression is important in adult tissues for the regulation of thyroid hormones (PMID: 25350068). In thyroid carcinomas, NKX2-1 is primarily expressed in follicular neoplasm and papillary carcinoma but not in anaplastic carcinoma (PMID: 12023581). Germline mutations in NKX2-1 have been identified in families affected by multinodular goiter and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PMID: 19176457). In lung adenocarcinoma, somatic mutations of NKX2-1 are rare but sustained expression of NKX2-1 is frequently associated with gene amplification (PMID: 17925434, 18212743, 17616654, 17982442). Loss of NKX2-1 expression is also associated with favorable prognosis and reduced metastasis in murine models and humans (PMID: 21471965, 23125078), likely due to altered differentiation programs controlled by NKX2-1 (PMID: 23523371). Rearrangements of NKX2-1 with T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin heavy chain loci have also been identified in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PMID: 21481790).	false

NKX3-1 (NK3 homeobox 1, also known as NKX3.1) is a homeobox-contiaing transcription factor and prostate-specific tumor suppressor that is under tight androgenic control (PMID: 11839815, 19886863, 11085535, 9226374). NKX3-1 is expressed at high levels in the prostate where it plays a role in tissue differentiation and homeostasis (PMID: 11839815, 8943214, 10215624), and is proposed to be a marker of prostate-specific stem cells (PMID: 19741607). Loss of heterozygosity of the 8p21 genomic locus, which includes NKX3-1, is associated with tissue dedifferentiation and lost of androgen response in prostate cancer (PMID: 9226374).

NPM1, also known as nucleophosmin, is a nucleolar phosphoprotein that has diverse cellular functions including regulation of ribosome biogenesis, mRNA processing, chromatin remodeling, apoptosis and DNA damage repair (PMID: 16007073). NPM1 has been implicated in the regulation of several DNA repair processes including homologous recombination, translesion synthesis, and repair of lesions created by UV light (PMID: 27553022). Loss of NPM1 has also been associated with increased genome instability (PMID: 16007073). In addition, NPM1 plays an important role in the regulation of the TP53 tumor suppressor pathway. The TP53-stabilizing protein ARF binds NPM1, sequestering ARF and NPM1 from binding the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that is responsible for degrading TP53. Disruption of the NPM1-ARF interaction allows NPM1 and ARF to inhibit MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 leading to apoptosis (PMID: 15144954,15684379). Translocations and loss-of-function mutations have been identified in various human lymphomas and leukemias (PMID: 15659725, 8122112, 17488663).

The NRG1 gene encodes six types of proteins with distinct N-terminal domains and at least 31 different isoforms, which all contain an EGF-binding domain (PMID: 18478032, 11042203). NRG1 growth factors are predominantly synthesized as membrane-bound proteins that are cleaved and released into the extracellular space; however, type III NRG1 isoforms have transmembrane and intracellular activities (PMID: 18478032, 9789034). NRG1 functions as a ligand for the HER receptor tyrosine kinases, with specificity for HER3 and HER4 (PMID: 11042203, 17250808). Binding of NRG1 via the EGF-domain initiates HER dimerization, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways including the MAPK and PI3K pathways (PMID: 18478032, 25501131). NRG1-mediated signaling regulates a variety of cellular functions including neuronal survival, migration, differentiation, and cellular proliferation, among others (PMID: 12821646, 18478032, 25501131).

Activity of NT5C2 is important for the maintenance of nucleotide pools and the export of excess purine nucleotides out of the cell (PMID: 29990496). NT5C2 functions as a dimer of dimers to dephosphorylate purine substrates including inosine monophosphate (IMP), xanthine monophosphate (XMP), and guanosine monophosphate (GMP), resulting in the clearance of purine nucleosides (PMID: 30201983). Nucleotide analog chemotherapies that disrupt DNA synthesis, such as cytarabine and thiopurines, are also targets of dephosphorylation by NT5C2, ultimately leading to their inactivation (PMID: 30201983). High expression of NT5C2 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia correlates with drug resistance and poor outcome (PMID: 16330448, 17350683, 26294725). Activating NT5C2 mutations are found in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, including childhood and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B-lymphoblastic leukemia, predominantly after relapse to nucleotide analog chemotherapies (PMID: 29990496, 23377183, 23377281, 25790293, 28253933). Gain-of-function NT5C2 mutations can activate NT5C2 by several distinct mechanisms: locking the enzymatic complex in an activate state, disrupting the NT5C2 off-switch, or loss of the negative regulation at the C-terminal (PMID: 29535428, 29990496). Germline NT5C2 variants have also been linked to relapse in hematopoietic and non-small cell lung cancers (PMID: 30201983, 22173087, 28573946). Expression of activating NT5C2 mutations in murine models results in impaired leukemia growth and tumor-initiating capacity due to the excessive export of purines, suggesting that NT5C2 functions as an oncogene at relapse but not at tumor initiation (PMID: 29342136). In preclinical studies, NT5C2-mutant leukemia cells were sensitive to blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibiting inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) (PMID: 29342136).	false

The NTHL1 gene encodes a protein involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. NTHL1 localizes in the nucleus, where it catalyzes the N-glycosylation of damaged DNA and subsequent cleavage of the resulting modified bond, constituting the first steps towards DNA repair in the base excision repair (BER) pathway (PMID: 10882850, 18166975, 21930793, 9890904, 17923696). Low NTHL1 expression has been associated with a decreased capacity for DNA repair in gastric cancer (PMID: 19414504). However, a dual role for NTHL1 has been described in irradiated cells; it both repairs potentially lethal DNA lesions and generates lethal double-strand breaks at radiation-induced sites (PMID: 16111924). NTHL1 interacts with PCNA and p53 proteins (PMID: 15358233). Germline truncating mutations of NTHL1 have been identified as the causal alteration in families with hereditary colorectal tumors and other neoplasias (PMID: 25938944, 26559593). Paradoxically, NTHL1 is somatically amplified in a subset of breast and pancreatic tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).	true

NTRK1 consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular region harboring the tyrosine kinase domain. Oncogenic activation of NTRK1 leads to autophosphorylation and activation of the MAP-kinase, PI3-kinase and PLC-Î³ pathways, mediating cell proliferation, survival and differentiation (PMID: 10851172, 12652644).

The NTRK2 gene (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2) encodes a transmembrane neurotrophic receptor involved in signaling that is important for normal neurologic development (PMID: 8402890, 8145823). NTRK2 consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular region harboring the tyrosine kinase domain. Normal activation in neural cells occurs upon binding one of its three ligands, the nerve growth factor (NGF), the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), leading to autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways controlling and promoting cell proliferation, survival and differentiation via MAPK, PI3K and PLC-Î³ (PMID: 1649702, 1649703, 10851172). NTRK2 alterations, especially fusions, are found in several human cancers, such as lung cancer, pilocytic astrocytoma, and neuroblastoma (PMID: 25204415, 21242122, 23817572, 8264643, 9049830).	false

The NTRK3 (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3) gene encodes a transmembrane neurotrophic receptor normally activated in neural cells upon binding of its main ligand, the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). NTRK3 consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular region harboring the tyrosine kinase domain. Activation of NTRK3 leads to autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of a downstream signaling pathway controlling cell proliferation, survival and differentiation via MAPK, PI3K and PLC-Î³ (PMID: 10851172). NTRK3 has been found altered, mainly in the form of oncogenic fusions, in several human cancers (PMID: 9462753, 11801301, 10895816, 12450792, 9823307, 25207766, 21401966, 24327398, 24135138, 23583981, 24705251).

The NUF2 gene encodes a protein involved in chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis. NUF2 is essential for kinetochore-microtubule interactions and spindle checkpoint activity (PMID: 15358233, 15239953, 15548592, 17535814, 15062103). Silencing of NUF2 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in normal and cancer cells (PMID: 12438418, 19878654, 25481014, 25370920, 25374179). The NUF2 gene is amplified in various tumors, including breast, prostate, bladder and liver (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016). NUF2 overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancers (PMID: 24247253), and RNA interference screens have implicated NUF2 as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancers (PMID: 23056589).	false

NUP214 is a nucleoporin found on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (PMID: 8108440). NUP214, a phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat-containing nucleoporin, is responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins and mRNA across the nuclear envelope in conjunction with NUP88 and the nuclear export receptor XPO1 (PMID: 7878057, 9488438, 8896451, 16943420). The FG-repeat of NUP214 is a disordered domain that contributes to selective transport while also acting as a selective barrier to specific proteins and RNAs, and mutations that alter this domain affect the movement of molecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (PMID: 16769882). Because NUP214 regulates the proteins and mRNA that cross the nuclear envelope, it plays a role in the regulation of cell cycle, mitosis and gene expression (PMID: 30669574, 9488438). NUP214 fusions such as SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214, which may arise de novo or due to prior treatment, have been identified in liquid tumors such as AML and ALL (PMID: 30669574) and are associated with disease that is characterized as more aggressive, with poor prognosis, higher risk of relapse, etc. (PMID: 24441146, 16628187, 30669574).	false

NUP93 is a subunit of the nuclear pore complex that is essential for the exchange of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope (PMID: 24572986). NUP93 activity promotes and maintains the correct assembly of the nuclear pore complex (PMID: 15229283, 22171326). Functional studies have suggested that NUP93 plays a role in gene regulation by tethering chromatin at superenhancer sites to generate the necessary structural environment for transcriptional repression or activation (PMID: 26341556, 27807035). Expression of NUP93, along with other members of the nucleoporin complex, is increased in cardiac tissue of patients with heart failure and decreased in the thymus of patients with Down syndrome (PMID: 23152829, 21856934). While NUP93 copy number alterations are observed in a variety of solid cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov. 2017), NUP93 mutations in human cancers are not common. However, a recent analysis identified the NUP93 E14K mutation as a hotspot mutation with unknown function in multiple cancers (PMID: 26619011).	false

NUP98 is a scaffold component of the nuclear pore complex, a large multi-protein structure embedded in the nuclear membrane that is required for nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking. Localization studies have shown that NUP98 is located on the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC and facilitates docking of proteins being imported into the nucleus from the cytoplasm (PMID: 7736573). During mitosis, the NPC disassembles along with the nuclear membrane, which is initiated by phosphorylation of proteins in the NPC. Studies have shown that hyperphosphorylation of NUP98 by CDK1 and Neks is an early and required step in the NPC disassembly and is proposed to be a rate-limiting step in the process (PMID: 21335236). NUP98 is fused to a variety of partner genes in hematologic malignancies (PMID: 21948299).	false

NUTM1 encodes the nuclear protein in testis (NUT), which is expressed in normal spermatocytes. NUTM1 is a novel gene located on chromosome 15; not much is known about its function, except that the protein harbors an acidic binding domain for the acetyltransferase p300 (PMID: 20676058). Most of the current knowledge on NUTM1 is focused on alterations involved in cancer (PMID: 17934517). More specifically, chromosomal translocations involving NUT and BRD proteinsâin particular BRD4, but also BRD3âare found in NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), a rare, aggressive, and lethal genetically defined epithelial cancer syndrome, characterized by the insurgence of carcinomas in various tissues along the upper midline of the body, that mainly affects young individuals (PMID: 17934517, 26551281, 24655834,12543779, 25675182). Approximately 75% of NMC cases feature BRD4-NUT translocation, where the fusion oncogene is expressed under the BRD4 promoter and consists of the first half of the BRD4 protein (which contains all of the functional domain of BRD4) and all of the coding region of NUT. Translocation leading to the fusion protein BRD3-NUT is less common. A novel translocation that results in the fusion protein NSD3-NUT has been observed in NMC of the lung (PMID: 25466466). In a small number of cases involving NUT rearrangements, called NUT variants, the partner of the translocation is unknown. These NUT variants are associated with longer survival, compared with BRD4-NUT carcinomas (PMID: 15483023). NUT rearrangements are found in 18% of cases of undifferentiated carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (PMID: 18391746).

ONECUT2 has a redundant role in the regulation of cellular development with ONECUT1 (PMID: 25228773). Overexpression of ONECUT2 in various types of cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting that ONECUT2 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31882655, 14656735, 29737581). Amplification of ONECUT2 has been identified in various cancers, including prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and small cell lung cancer (PMID: 25788493, 26547929, 34155000).

P2RY8 is an orphan receptor that is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family (GPCRs). GPCRs signal by association with heterotrimeric G proteins at the plasma membrane and function as exchange factors leading to G-protein activation (PMID: 30262890). P2RY8 signals via the G-protein GNA13 and the downstream effector ARHGEF1, leading to activation of signaling pathways (PMID: 26573295). P2RY8 is highly expressed in germinal center B cells; functional studies in murine B cells demonstrate that P2RY8 suppresses B cell growth and mediates B cell positioning in the germinal center in a GNA13-dependent manner (PMID: 25274307, 26573295). In addition, P2RY8 is required to promote the clustering of activated B cells within follicles in collaboration with follicular dendritic cells (PMID: 26573295). P2RY8 fusions are found in patients with B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and ALL-associated Down Syndrome (PMID: 19838194). P2RY8 predominantly fuses with CRLF2, and P2RY8-CRLF2 rearrangements are associated with relapse and poor prognosis in ALL (PMID: 20139093, 22484421). In addition, loss-of-function P2RY8 mutations have been identified in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DBLCL) and follicular lymphomas; however, the function of these mutations have yet to be determined (PMID: 22343534, 27959929).	true

PAK1 is serine/threonine protein kinase that in physiologic states is expressed in a wide variety of tissue types and plays important roles in cytoskeletal remodeling, cell motility, adhesion and survival (PMID: 21653999). PAK1 is overexpressed in several cancer types, through amplification of the PAK1 gene on chromosome 11q13, a feature most commonly described in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast carcinomas (PMID: 9533029) or through other mechanisms. PAK1 plays several roles in oncogenesis, including increasing cancer proliferation through activation of MAPK signaling (PMID: 7592806), mediation of the oncogenic transformation caused by ErbB2 overexpression (PMID: 23576562), activation of the Wnt pathway (PMID: 21822311), inhibition of apoptosis through activation of BAD (PMID: 15849194, 10611223) and promotion of cancer cell metastasis through direct action on the cytoskeleton (PMID: 21196207).	false

PAK5 (also PAK7) is a serine/threonine kinase and member of the PAK family of proteins, which function as downstream effectors of Rho GTPases (PMID: 24869804). PAK5 is predominantly expressed in neuronal cell types and functions as a target of the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and RAC (PMID: 11756552, 12860998). Cdc42 cycles between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state, in which PAK5 binds activated Cdc42 to initiate downstream signaling pathways (PMID: 24869804). PAK5 mediates a variety of cellular functions including regulation of MAPK and JNK signaling, as well as cell motility and survival (PMID: 12032833, 11756552, 18199048), apoptosis via phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (PMID: 12897128, 20567954), and cytoskeletal stability (PMID: 16014608, 20564219). In neuronal cell types, PAK5 is predominantly localized in the mitochondria (PMID: 12897128) and expression of PAK5 leads to the induction of neurite formation via downstream activity of Cdc42 and Rac (PMID: 11756552, 15322108). Loss of PAK5 expression in mice results in defects in memory and learning and variants in PAK5 have been associated with the risk of psychosis in humans (PMID: 24474471). PAK5 overexpression has been identified in a variety of human tumor types including lung cancer, gastric cancer and melanoma, among others (PMID: 19415746, 16845324, 20564219, 23685956, 23106939, 25052921, 26116538). Expression of PAK5 in preclinical studies has been associated with increased invasion and migration and cellular protection from apoptosis (PMID: 25726523, 19415746, 20567954). Somatic variants in PAK5 are rare in human cancers; however, mutations in PAK5 have been identified in melanoma and lung cancer and are predicted to result in gain-of-function activity (PMID: 29875996, 23836671, 17344846).	false

Germline mutations of PALB2 are associated with Fanconi anemia and predispose to breast cancer.	PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2, also known as FANCN) encodes a DNA-repair factor and BRCA2 binding protein (PMID: 16793542). PALB2 acts as a scaffold protein in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, likely mediating recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 at damaged loci (PMID: 19423707). PALB2 also interacts with BRCA1, possibly functioning as an intermediary factor between BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the HR pathway (PMID: 19268590, 19584259). Preclinical data show that mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 can abrogate interaction with PALB2 and disrupt HR-mediated DNA repair (PMID: 19369211, 16793542). Germline biallelic mutations of PALB2 are linked to the hereditary disease Fanconi Anemia, which predisposes to various cancers (PMID: 20858716,17200671, 17200672). PALB2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene with some indications for a lesser effect in ovarian, pancreatic, prostate cancer and melanoma (PMID: 17200668, 17287723, 17420451, 18053174, 25099575, 20858716, 19264984, 24448499).

PARP1 inhibition has been shown to be effective in germline BRCA-deficient tumors, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and ovarian serous papillary carcinoma.	PARP1 encodes a nuclear localized poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that transfers an ADP-ribose group to target proteins. PARP1 activity has been implicated in several biological processes including DNA repair, DNA replication, transcription, and chromatin remodeling (PMID: 9315851, 26184161). After induction of DNA damage, PARP1 binds to sites of single-strand breaks and recruits DNA repair proteins to the site of damage (PMID: 9315851, 26184161). PARP1 is also a key factor in regulating other biological and oncogenic processes, including maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic development, cell reprogramming and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 17286852, 22902501, 23939864, 21095583, 19262751, 26184161). Functional studies have demonstrated that PARP1 loss leads to genomic instability and resistance to DNA damage-induced cell death (PMID: 24916104). PARP1 is highly expressed in several human cancers, however, PARP1 mutations are rare (PMID: 25528020). In the absence of PARP1, single-strand breaks cause replication fork collapse resulting in double-stranded breaks and ultimately triggering DNA repair by homologous recombination pathways involving DNA repair genes such as BRCA1/2 (PMID: 24916104, 25286972). PARP1 inhibitors have been developed to leverage the ability of PARP1 to induce double-strand breaks in cancers with mutations in DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1/2, resulting in inefficient repair and cell death (PMID: 15829967, 19351835, 20858840, 25286972). PARP inhibitors have also been shown to be efficacious in other tumor types that share clinicopathological characteristics with BRCA-mutant tumors (âBRCAnessâ), such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and ovarian serous papillary carcinoma (PMID: 16912188).

Translocations of PAX5 are found in lymphomas and leukemias.	PAX5 is a protein in the paired-box family of transcription factors that is important in early B-cell development and differentiation (PMID:10524622). PAX5 plays a key role in the commitment of bone marrow multipotent progenitors to the B-lymphoid lineage by favoring VDJ gene rearrangement and activating the expression of B-cell-specific genes (PMID: 9442394) while simultaneously repressing genes involved in other hematopoietic differentiation programs (PMID: 12479824). The oncogenic function of PAX5 is likely tissue specific. PAX5 deficiency in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and models induces leukemia development and aberrant B-cell development and differentiation, suggesting that PAX5 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in this context (PMID: 25855603, 24939936, 30643249). Inactivating mutations, hypermethylation, translocations and deletions of PAX5 have been found in B-ALL, pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and breast cancer (PMID: 17344859, 8943844, 25855603, 19020546, 37403081). A germline susceptibility mutation in PAX5 for development of B-ALL has also been identified (PMID: 24013638). Conversely, expression of PAX5 in other cancer cell models induces increased cancer cell viability, promotion of c-Met transcription and confers cisplatin resistance, suggesting that PAX5 functions predominantly as an oncogene in these tissue contexts (PMID: 19139719, 9815975, 29964012).

All PAX proteins contain a paired box DNA-binding domain, a homeo box DNA-binding domain and a transactivation domain (PMID: 24496612). The expression of PAX genes is temporally and spatially restricted during organogenesis and these genes play a key role in controlling cell fate during early development (PMID: 24496612). PAX8 is the only member of the family expressed in the thyroid tissue; it is involved in thyroid follicular cell development and expression of thyroid-specific genes, and also functions in very early stages organogenesis of the kidney, the gynecologic tract and the thymus (PMID: 1337742). A fusion protein, PAX8-PPARÎ³, is implicated in some follicular thyroid carcinomas and follicular-variant papillary thyroid carcinomas (PMID: 10958784). An array of heterogenous mutations of PAX8 have been seen in thyroid dysgenesis, which causes congenital hypothyroidism (PMID: 25231445).	false

Inactivating mutations of PBRM1 are frequently found in renal carcinoma.	The PBRM1 gene encodes the protein BAF180, which is a component of the nucleosome-remodeling complex switching defective/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) (PMID: 21248752). Nucleosomes are histone octamers around which DNA is wrapped in order to regulate its exposure to transcription factors and RNA polymerases (PMID: 23113498). Remodeling complexes such as the SWI/SNF family serve to loosen, reposition and break DNA/histone contacts ultimately rendering the DNA accessible to modulation (PMID: 21654818). BAF180 contains 6 bromodomains, which bind to lysine residues in histone tails (PMID:19084573, PMID:22435813). Aberrations of each individual bromodomain are sufficient to disrupt the protein's function as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 22435813, PMID:24613357). Specifically, one study demonstrated that BAF180 is among the key components required for p53-dependent cellular senescence (PMID:20660729). Additional work focusing on breast cancer cell lines identified BAF180 as a critical promoter in the induction of p21 activity, which functions as a key component of cell cycle regulatory functions (PMID:18339845). PBRM1 truncation mutants can no longer bind and remodel the p21 locus leading to cell cycle defects and aberrant cell proliferation (PMID: 18339845, 22949125). Loss of PBRM1 activity is also associated with chromosomal instability due to its inability to promote cohesion (PMID: 24613357).	true	
ENST00000303577	NM_006196.3	ENST00000303577	NM_006196.3	5093	PCBP1	false			PCBP1, an RNA binding protein, is recurrently altered by mutation in Burkitt's lymphoma and gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.	PCBP1 (also alpha-CP1 and HNRNP E1) is an RNA binding protein that mediates transcription, translation and alternative splicing of mRNA molecules in a variety of contexts (PMID: 17389360). PCBP1 functions as a poly(rc)-binding protein (PMID: 7607214) that binds cloverleaf and large stem-loop IV mRNA structures (PMID: 10608888). The proteins PCBP1 and PCBP2 are translated from the same intronless gene and can cooperate to regulate RNA binding in collaboration with other components, including the hnRNPK ribonucleoparticle (PMID: 7607214, 9257647, 10455157). PCBP1 has been implicated in the stability of a variety of mRNA substrates including alpha-globin (PMID: 9234743), the androgen receptor (PMID: 12011088), EPO (PMID: 10068686), p21(WAF1) (PMID: 12431987), the folate receptor (PMID: 14722620), histone molecules (PMID: 18656558) and STAT3 (PMID: 14722620), among others. PCBP1 activity regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression (PMID: 19211566), metastasis (PMID: 20154680, 26096938), and alternative splicing in both normal and malignant cells (PMID: 20361869, 27746021). For example, TGF-Î² activity promotes PCBP1 regulation of SMAD3, a critical mediator of metastasis (PMID: 27746021, 20154680, 26096938). Somatic mutations in PCBP1 are found in Burkittâs lymphoma and gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and these alterations are predicted to disrupt mRNA stability and alternative splicing (PMID: 29622466, 26173642). PCBP1 regulates a diverse range of substrates implicated in oncogenesis and therefore can function as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene (PMID: 18656558).	false	
ENST00000334409	NM_005018.2	ENST00000334409	NM_005018.2	5133	PDCD1	true			PDCD1 is a key mediator of immune self tolerance and several cancer entities highly express PDCD1 to evade anti-tumoral immune response. Anti-PD1 therapy has been successful in PD1 expressing cancer.	PDCD1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) encodes the protein PD1, which is a coinhibitory receptor expressed on T-cells and pro-B cells that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (PMID: 20636820, 12421930). PD1 acts to inhibit an immune response by binding to the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed on other normal or malignant cells (PMID: 17629517). PD-L1 binding to PD1 leads to programmed cell death in antigen-specific T-cells and reduced apoptosis in regulatory T-cells, which results in an overall decrease in immune response (PMID: 11857337, 16382236, 20208540). Amplification or overexpression of PD1 has been identified in some tumor types and can be predictive of responses to immunotherapy (PMID: 22437870, 26918453, 28652380, 27620277). Antibodies targeting PD1 have been developed and assessed in clinical trials that block the immune evasive PD-L1/PD1 interaction. Atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (PMID: 28424325) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy (PMID: 28611199). Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, is considered first-line therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanomas that express PD-L1 and may be efficacious in other tumors that express PD-L1 (PMID: 28806116). Nivolumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1, is also effective in tumors with high PD-L1 expression due to the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and activation of a robust immune response (PMID: 28806116). Tumors with defects in mismatch-repair and overexpression of PD-L1 should be considered for PD-1 blockade (PMID: 26028255).	false

"The PDCD1LG2 gene encodes the ""programmed cell death 1 ligand 2"" (PD-L2) protein. PD-L2 is highly similar to PD-L1, a protein whose overexpression by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) leads to negative regulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and subsequent tumor immune evasion (PMID: 15599732, 22437870, 16864790). PD-L2 binding affinity for PD-1 is higher than PD-L1, although the biological consequences of this are unknown (PMID: 12893276). PD-L2 is also expressed in activated T-helper cells type 2 (Th2), inhibiting its function and regulating IFN-Î³ production (PMID: 21752471). Impaired tumor growth has been observed in several in vitro and in vivo cancer models upon dual PD-L1/PD-L2 inhibition, but the specific additive role for the latter remains elusive (PMID: 22611421). PDCD1LG2 overexpression or amplification has been reported in renal, cervical and breast cancers, among others, and in some cases predicts poor prognosis (PMID: 26464193, 26913631, 26424759, 26752545, 26317899, 24270737, 15837746).

PDGFB is a signaling ligand that is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor family (PMID: 7073684, 18483217). PDGFB encodes a precursor peptide that requires intracellular, proteolytic processing to initiate receptor binding (PMID: 16007151). Receptor binding activity of PDGFB is also dependent on ligand dimerization, either as a homodimer or a heterodimer with family member PDGFRA, to form PDGF-BB or PDGF-AB (PMID: 2836952, 18483217). PDGF dimers activate PDGF receptor kinases in a context-specific manner, dependent on ligand configuration and receptor expression (PMID: 28267575). PDGFR signaling mediates a variety of downstream signaling effectors including PI3K, MAPK, and PLC-Î³, among others (PMID: 18483217). These signaling pathways regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, differentiation, and invasion (PMID: 18483217). Overexpression of PDGFB is implicated in several cancer types and promotes tumor progression in preclinical studies (PMID: 18478301). Rearrangements involving PDGFB are found in patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a sarcoma of the skin (PMID: 17431412, 12131162). These translocations result in enhanced expression of PDGFB and increased PDGFR signaling activity, suggesting that PDGFRB functions as an oncogene (PMID: 17431412, 12131162). Several small molecule inhibitors targeting PDGFR may be efficacious in patients with increased PDGFB signaling (PMID: 26261104, 26261104).	false

The PDGFRA gene encodes for the protein Platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRA). Binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of PDGFRA, which contains immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, causes dimerization followed by autophosphorylation of the receptor and activation of downstream pathways such as RAS-MAPK, PI3K and PLC-Î³ that are involved in developmental and cellular responses. The catalytic activity of PDGFRA is mediated through the split intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; PDGFRA binds to all PDGF ligand isoforms except PDGF-DD (PMID:18483217, 24703957). Mutations, insertions, deletions, fusions and genomic amplification of PDGFRA lead to its activation in several tumor types: ~7% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have PDGFRA activating mutations and these mutations are mutually exclusive from KIT mutations (PMID: 20023271); activating mutations in PDGFRA have been been reported in ~5% of Chinese melanoma patients (PMID:24132921); amplification of PDGFRA is the second most frequent receptor tyrosine kinase amplification in glioblastoma (GBM), is found in ~7-15% of GBM tumors and is often associated with in-frame deletions (PMID:18772890,19915670, 22323597, 20129251, 20889717); amplification of the PDGFRA locus has been reported in more than 80% of intimal sarcomas (PMID:20685895), ~19% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PMID:16357008), 3-7% of non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas and 8-10% non-small cell lung squamous cell carcinomas (PMID:19755855); activating mutations have been found in ~5% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and in ~14% of non-brain stem pediatric high-grade gliomas, around 40% of these occurring in the context of PDGFRA amplification (PMID:23970477); chimeric fusion transcripts to the catalytic domain of PDGFRA have been reported in select cases of GBM (PMID:20889717), chronic myeloid leukemia (PMID:12023981,12944919, 15034867) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) (PMID:12660384, 19187542, 16498388, 16845659, 17555450).

PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta), is a transmembrane receptor-tyrosine kinase whose ligands are the homodimers PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD (PMID: 18483217, 20581310). Upon binding to PDGF ligand, the receptor undergoes homodimerization (or heterodimerization with PDGFRÎ±), bringing the intracellular kinase domains into proximity and triggering kinase activation. Downstream signaling pathways include JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, PLCÎ³, and NF-ÎºB (PMID: 18483217, 20581310). PDGFRB is primarily expressed on cells of mesenchymal origin (e.g. fibroblasts, endothelium) and is involved in organ development, angiogenesis and wound repair (PMID: 7958864, 10375497, 18483217, 20581310). Although PDGFRB plays a role in early hematopoiesis, its role in adult hematopoietic cells is less clear (PMID: 7958864, 11264163). Pathologic overexpression of PDGFRB in hematopoietic cells contributes to neoplastic growth and progression (PMID: 20581310). Although PDGF/PDGFR signaling appears to play an important role in numerous types of solid tumors, mutations, amplifications or translocations/fusions of PDGFRB are relatively rare in most solid tumors (PMID: 18483217).	false

Amplifications of PDPK1 are found in breast and thyroid cancers.	PDPK1 (also known as PDK1) encodes for 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 that mediates downstream signaling from phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). It is a serine-threonine kinase that responds to mitogenic and insulin signals to phosphorylate targets including the AGC family of kinases such as p70 S6K and AKT (PMID:10801415, 9094314, 9427642). Breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells have shown dependency on PDPK1 for survival and tumor progression (PMID:19573809, 25269480). In pancreatic cancer, PDPK1 signaling can contribute to Kras oncogenic activity (PMID:23453624). The PDPK1 gene has been found to be amplified in breast and thyroid cancers (PMID:19602588, 18492751).

PDS5B (also AS3 and APRIN) is a protein that binds cohesin, a ring-like structure that regulates sister chromatid segregation during cell division (PMID: 15855230). PDS5B mediates cohesin-dependent sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis or meiosis to ensure proper chromosome-spindle attachments (PMID: 26903600). In addition, PDS5B activity is important for the maintenance of the curved interface of the cohesin ring and for the dissolution of the cohesin complex during mitosis to allow for appropriate chromosome segregation (PMID: 15855230, 27549742). PDS5B mediates additional cellular functions including regulation of stem cell function (PMID: 20383194) and chromatin looping (PMID: 29217591). PDS5B also interacts with BRCA2 to mediate DNA repair and is located on a chromosomal region that contains BRCA2 that is commonly lost in breast cancer (PMID: 22293751). Loss of PDS5B expression results in chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and developmental defects in mice (PMID: 17652350, 24141881). PDS5B also mediates androgen-dependent signals that are required for growth arrest in prostate cells (PMID: 18499069, 10215036, 10963680). Germline mutations in PDS5B are found in patients with cohesinopathies, such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome (PMID: 19412548). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in PDS5B are found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia as well as some solid tumors (PMID: 26492932, 23850494, 19737411), suggesting that PDS5B functions as a tumor suppressor.

PGBD5 is a DNA transposase that is a member of the piggyBac transposase family (PMID: 24180413, 26406119). piggyBac transposases mediate the mobility of genetic elements flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITR) and reintegrate these elements, termed transposons, into another location in the genome via a âcut and pasteâ mechanism (PMID: 24180413, 26406119). Transposons mediate genetic evolution and comprise half of the human genome, with PGDB5 functioning as the most conserved transposase in humans (PMID: 26406119). PGBD5 is predominantly expressed in the brain and in the central nervous system during development (PMID: 24180413). Increased expression of PGBD5 in cell lines and murine models results in transformation, suggesting that PGBD5 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 28504702). Overexpression of PGBD5 is found in childhood cancers including rhabdoid tumors, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma and Ewing sarcoma (PMID: 28504702, 30333322). PGBD5 promotes the formation of chromosomal rearrangements by binding site-specific sequences and disrupting the expression of tumor suppressor genes (PMID: 30333322).

It bind to progesterone in the cytoplasm and dimerizes. The complex then enters the nucleus and binds to DNA. PR then modulates transcription depending on its isoform and on the pattern of phosphorylation at a large number of possible sites (PMID: 11110801). PR is essential in the coordination of the reproductive cycle and is especially associated with the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. PR has been shown to interact with STAT3 (PMID: 21184768) and the SP1 transcription factor (PMID: 21184768).The PR protein is commonly expressed in breast and endometrial tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2016; PMID: 11041059, 8319181) and provides a key prognostic indicator alongside the presence and absence of estrogen receptor (ER) (PMID: 1634918).

PHOX2B mutations can lead to congenital central hypo-ventilation syndrome (CCHS) and Hirschprung's disease (PMID: 12640453, 12631670). Patients with PHOX2B mutant CCHS have a higher incidence of neuroblastoma and a subset of hereditary as well as sporadic neuroblastoma show PHOX2B mutations (PMID: 15516980, 10360575, 15024693). In neuroblastoma PHOX2B mutations lead to impaired neuroblast differentiation, but the exact mechanisms are not yet clear (PMID: 25124476, 12612655).	true

PIGA (also PIG-A) is an enzyme involved in the first step of the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway (PMID: 8500164). Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are post-translational modifications that attach the C-terminal of extracellular proteins to the cellular membrane (PMID: 8500164, 22265715). Cell surface proteins require GPI anchors for attachment at the membrane as well as for protein sorting, signal transduction, and immune regulation (PMID: 25885527). GPI anchors are added to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) prior to protein sorting (PMID: 8500164, 9463366). PIGA is the catalytic enzyme in the GPI-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (GlcNAc) complex that is responsible for the first step in GPI synthesis (PMID: 8500164, 9463366). PIG-A initiates the formation of the intermediate N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol by transferring GlcNAc to phosphatidylinsositol (PI) (PMID: 8500164). GPI anchoring is required during embryogenesis and loss of PIGA in mice results in embryonic lethality (PMID: 7851884). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in PIGA are found in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a clonal hematopoietic malignancy that leads to anemia and a predisposition for leukemia (PMID: 10220445, 10627475, 10048414). Patients with PNH present with red blood cells that cannot express proteins at the membrane that require GPI anchoring, including the complement proteins CD55 and CD59 (PMID: 10220445, 8946596). Because PIGA loss results in depletion of important cell surface proteins from the membrane, a PIG-A assay has been developed to test for mutations in response to genotoxic stress (PMID: 24798381, 27637482, 20034593).	true

Inactivating mutations of PIK3C2G are found in melanomas and lung and gastrointestinal cancers.	PIK3C2G is a class II catalytic subunit of PI3-Kinase (PMID: 25785104). PIK3C2G acts as a lipid kinase to create phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), which acts as a secondary messenger in key signaling pathways involved in cell cycle, motility, differentiation and transformation (PMID: 10209156). Class II PI3Ks are the least studied, however, they are defined by the presence of a carboxyl-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding motif (PMID: 22507127). PIK3C2G is mutated in a number of cancers, and a large proportion of these mutations are predicted to be inactivating mutations.	false

PIK3C3, also known as VPS34, is a class III catalytic subunit of PI3K and is important in creating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). PIK3C3 plays an important role in the maturation of autophagosomes and the transport of lysosomal enzyme precursors to lysosomes (PMID: 20562532, 22498475). PIK3C3 is also involved in mTOR signaling, which regulates autophagy in response to nutrient sensing in the cell (PMID: 24013218).

Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is comprised of a regulatory subunit (p85Î±) as well as a catalytic subunit (p110Î±) and it is the catalytic subunit that is encoded by the PIK3CA gene. PIK3CA is among the most commonly mutated genes in cancer and aberrant activation of PI3K is a transforming event (PMID: 17376864). Multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), RET, MET, and VEGFR, among others, convert extracellular cues into intracellular signals and recruit PI3K to the plasma membrane via scaffold proteins such as IRS1 or by activating RAS. Upon stimulation, PI3K-110Î± converts its lipid substrate PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol - 4,5 - bisphosphate) to PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol - 3,4,5 - bisphosphate), which activates several signaling cascades, including the well-characterized AKT-mTOR pathway. Once activated, AKT-mTOR downstream signaling promotes cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility (PMID: 16341083). Adding to this complexity, exposure to some PI3K/mTOR pathway-targeted drugs relieves cancer cells of self-regulatory properties inherent in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway thereby promoting tumor resistance to these agents (PMID: 22576208).	false

PIK3CB, also known as p110-Î², is a catalytic subunit of PI3K that is important in creating phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which acts as a secondary messenger in key cellular signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR. PIK3CB plays a critical role in tumorigenesis driven by loss of PTEN (PMID: 18755892, 18594509) and drives PI3K signaling. Roles other than oncogenic activation of PI3K/AKT pathway have also been described for PIK3CB, including effects on growth and cell metabolism, including insulin signaling (PMID: 18594509, 18780892, 26132308). In HER2-amplified and PIK3CA-mutant cancers, inhibition of PIK3CA can lead to reactivation of PI3K signaling through PIK3CB (PMID: 25544637). Hence, combined inhibition of both isoforms is a promising therapeutic strategy that blocks pathway activation and leads to successful tumor regression (PMID: 25544636, 25544637, 25409150).	false

Inactivating mutations of PIK3CD are found in uterine, endometrial and colorectal cancers, among others.	PIK3CD, also known as p110-áº, is a catalytic subunit of PI3K that is important in creating phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which acts as a secondary messenger in key cellular signaling pathways such as AKT-mTOR. PIK3CD primarily functions in immune cells through AKT signaling. It is required for T-cell receptor activation (PMID: 12130661), and it is also necessary for a full antibody response in B-cells (PMID: 12235209). Germline mutations in PIK3CD likely causes both immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative disease as a result of hyperactivation of AKT-mTOR signaling, which forces the differentiation of naive CD8+ T-cells into short-lived effector cells and reduces long-term memory T- and B-cells (PMID: 24165795). Idelalisib, a specific inhibitor of PIK3CD, has been used with Rituximab (a CD20 antibody) in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and has been associated with significant increase in progression-free survival (PMID: 24450857).	false

Inactivating mutations of PIK3CG are found in uterine, endometrial, skin and lung cancers, among others.	PIK3CG (phosphatidelinositol-4,5-bisphophsphate3-kinase catalytic subunit gamma), also known as p110-gamma, is a class I catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase and acts as a lipid and protein kinase that phosphorylates phosphoinositides (PMID: 17290298). PIK3CG is involved in extracellular signaling and linking cell-surface receptors to intracellular signaling networks, such as the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway (PMID:12040186). Once activated, AKT-mTOR downstream signaling promotes cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility (PMID: 16341083). PIK3CG is primarily expressed in white blood cells, and through its direct interactions with RAS and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (PMID:12507995) is important in immune cell responses and inflammatory stimuli (PMID:10669418). While deletions of PIK3CG are often found in myeloid malignancies in conjunction with broad 7q22 deletion, PIK3CG is not likely a tumor suppressor in these settings (PMID: 11756194).	false

PIK3R1 encodes p85Î±, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)(PMID: 12040186). In the absence of upstream receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation, p85Î± both stabilizes and inhibits the activity of p110Î±, the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Upon RTK activation, p85Î± binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of RTKs. Subsequently, this recruits the PI3K enzymatic complex to the cell membrane and allows the p110Î± catalytic subunit to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (PMID: 12040186, 1707345, 2833705). The production of PIP3 results in recruitment and activation of the serine/threonine kinase, AKT, which in turn activates numerous downstream targets (e.g. mTOR) involved in cell growth, proliferation and survival (PMID: 12094235). PIK3R1 mutations occur most frequently in its two SRC Homology 2 (SH2) domains, nSH2 and iSH2 (PMID: 21478295, 19962665). These mutations disrupt the ability of p85Î± to inhibit the PI3K catalytic subunit, thus resulting in aberrant activation of AKT-mTOR signaling (PMID: 9450999, 11606375, 15932879, 17626883, 18079394, 19962665). Across all tumor types, PIK3R1 mutations tend to be mutually exclusive with alterations in TP53, PIK3CA, SETD2 and WT1 (PMID: 24132290). PIK3R1 mutations are prevalent in glioblastoma and to a lesser extent in endometrial, breast and colorectal cancers (PMID: 23636398, 24120142, 17932254, 22810696).	true

DAG and IP3 are secondary messengers that mediate cellular signaling pathways (PMID: 29174396, 23140367). IP3 binds calcium-mediated receptors resulting in an increase in cytosolic calcium concentrations and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (PMID: 9096335, 10373546, 19179337). PLCG1 activity is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFR, VEGFR, and EGFR, in response to hormones and growth factors (PMID: 9096335). PLCG1-regulated signal transduction pathways, such as the MAPK and JNK pathways, regulate a variety of cellular processes including migration, proliferation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis and transformation (PMID: 11931670, 15944397).

PMAIP1, also known as NOXA, encodes for phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1, a gene involved in regulating apoptosis (PMID:15694340). PMAIP1 contains a Bcl2 homology 3 (BH3) domain that mediates interactions with Bcl-2 family member proteins to alter the balance towards pro-apoptosis (PMID:15901672). Specifically, inhibition of Mcl-1 by PMAIP1 can lead to mitochondrial cytochrome c release and cell death (PMID:17115033).

PMS1 is one of four MutL homologs that functions in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, which is important in detecting and repairing nucleotide base mismatches. Within the MMR system, PMS1 forms a heterodimer with MLH1 (known as the MutLÎ² complex); in humans the specific function of this complex is unknown (PMID: 24614649, 16136382). The MMR system primarily acts as a sensory system that scans newly synthesized DNA for base pair mismatches caused by DNA polymerase strand slippage. Upon recognition of DNA mismatches, the MMR system recruits repair enzymes that excise mismatched bases and initiates resynthesis along the parental template by DNA polymerase. Loss of function of the MMR system leads to an accumulation of distinct single nucleotide mutations and alterations known as microsatellite instability (MSI), which can cause frameshift mutations or protein truncations, potentially increasing the risk of tumorigenesis (PMID: 24614649). Germline mutations in PMS1 have been shown to be involved in Lynch syndrome, which can cause a predisposition to certain types of cancer, including colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer (PMID: 15528792). Patients who are MMR-deficient have also been shown to respond well to PD-1 blockade immunotherapies, hence the FDA-approval of pembrolizumab for patients with MSI-high or MMR-deficient tumors regardless of tumor etiology (PMID: 26028255).	true

Mutations in PMS2 lead to an inability to correctly repair mismatches and insertion/deletion loops in the DNA, which results in increased tumor hypermutation and a microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) phenotype (PMID: 14871975). Germline mutations of PMS2 can cause Lynch syndrome, which predisposes to certain cancers including colon, endometrial and ovarian cancers and implicates PMS2 as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 16472587). Sporadic PMS2 mutations have also been reported in cancers from numerous tissue types (PMID: 16472587). Tumor hypermutation has been associated with response to certain immunotherapies.

PNRC1 is a nuclear receptor coactivator that modulates the transcriptional activation of a variety of nuclear receptors. Among these, the nuclear receptors (e.g. estrogen receptor Î± and Î², progesterone receptor, androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor) bind PNRC1 in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas the orphan receptors (e.g. steroidogenic factor 1 and estrogen-related receptor Î± 1) interact with PNRC1 in a ligand-independent manner (PMID: 23925889, 17068076, 15604093). PNRC1 also stimulates transcription by RNA polymerase III through direct binding of its subunit RPC39 (PMID: 7578250, 10894149, 17612402). In addition to its function as a modulator of transcription, PNRC1 plays an important role in the Ras-MAPK pathway, where it downregulates the signaling cascade through its interaction with Grb2 (PMID: 15122321). Downregulation of PNRC1 has been observed in various tumor types including breast, gastric, hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas; however, somatic mutations in PNRC1 are infrequent in human cancers (PMID: 15122321, 11768609).	false

Furthermore, reduced expression of POLD1 was associated with fragile site instability and a high frequency of chromosomal aberrations (PMID: 11003646, 18591249). Recent studies have demonstrated that levels of POLD1 protein decrease with age, resulting in reduced DNA repair capacity (PMID: 22915169, 21556771). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 are responsible for several disorders including the distinct multisystem disorder characterized by subcutaneous lipodystrophy, deafness, mandibular hypoplasia and hypogonadism in males (PMID: 23770608, 25131834). Heterozygous germline mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLD1 also predispose individuals to colorectal and endometrial cancers (PMID: 23263490, 24501277, 23528559, 26133394). In addition, associations between POLD1 variants and breast cancer risk have been shown in several studies (PMID: 15113441, 25023197, 16685647). POLD1 mutations have been identified as drivers of hypermutation, and therefore, cancers with POLD1 variants may be increasingly sensitive to immunotherapy (PMID; 29056344).	true

Select POLE mutations lead to ultra-high mutation rates, most frequently in endometrial and colorectal cancer.	"POLE is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase Îµ, the replicative DNA polymerase that extends the leading strand during DNA replication (PMID: 24861832). POLE contains an exonuclease ""proofreading"" domain, which replaces incorrectly incorporated nucleotides spontaneously during faithful replication (PMID: 24861832). Germline loss-of-function mutations in POLE have been identified in patients with polyposis and predisposition to colorectal cancer (PMID: 26133394, 29072370, 24501277). Several recurrent mutation hotspots in the exonuclease domain of POLE have been identified as impacting its proofreading capability and leading to ultra-high mutation rates, primarily in cancers of the colon, rectum and endometrium. Somatic mutations in the proofreading domain of POLE have been reported in endometrial cancers (PMID: 23636398, 25505230) and colorectal cancers (PMID: 25228659). In some contexts, POLE mutations have been associated with hypermutation, increased mutation load and better response to checkpoint inhibition in human cancers (PMID: 29056344, 29489427, 27159395, 28188185, 27486176, 31415061).

Mutations in POLG are associated with inherited mitochondrial disorders, including Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome.	POLG (DNA polymerase gamma) is a mitochondrial DNA polymerase involved in the replication and maintenance of the mitochondrial genome (PMID: 10827171). POLG contains a catalytic subunit with both polymerase and 3'-5' proofreading exonuclease domains, as well as an accessory subunit involved in maintaining processivity (PMID: 19837034, 10827171). Mutations in the polymerase domain of POLG lead to reduction in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, decreased oxidative phosphorylation and increased cell migration in breast cancer cell lines (PMID: 19629138). Furthermore, mice with POLG mutations affecting the exonuclease domain exhibit accumulation of mtDNA mutations, earlier onset of aging phenotypes and increased apoptotic markers compared to wildtype (PMID: 16020738). Autosomal dominant or recessive mutations in POLG, mostly in the polymerase domain, are associated with mitochondrial diseases such as Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PMID: 23545419, 11431686).  POLG is mutated by missense mutations in patients with breast cancer (PMID: 19629138).	false

POT1 is a telomere binding protein that is a component of shelterin (PMID: 29149597, 30208292). Shelterin is a protein complex that protects the ends of chromosomes, or telomeres, from inappropriate DNA repair mechanisms (PMID: 27218840). Telomeres are repetitive sequences at the end of chromosomes that prevent fusion with other chromosomes, maintain chromosome integrity, and are implicated in aging and cancer (PMID: 15181449). POT1 is an oligonucleotide binding protein that interacts with single-stranded DNA on telomeres and controls telomerase-mediated telomere elongation (PMID: 12768206). In addition, POT1 binds other telomere regulatory proteins including TRF1 (Telomere Repeat Factor 1), which inhibits unnecessary telomere extension (PMID: 15231715). POT1 also interacts with other telomere interacting proteins including PIP1 (POT-interacting protein), TIN2 (TRF1-interacting factor) and TPP1, among others, to maintain telomere stability and to recruit telomerase (PMID: 15231715, 15181449). Disruption of these protein interactions with POT1 results in aberrant mutagenic alternative non-homologous end joining (A-NHEJ) leading to genomic instability and chromosome fusions (PMID: 28393832, 27869160). Inhibition of POT1 expression also results in the activation of ATR-dependent DNA damage resulting in replication stress (PMID: 27239034). Germline loss-of-function mutations in POT1 are found in familial cutaneous melanoma, lymphoma and glioma (PMID: 24686849, 25482530, 29693246). Somatic loss-of-function POT1 mutations are found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and disrupt oligonucleotide binding activity (PMID: 23502782). POT1 mutations are predicted to promote genome instability due to the inability of POT1 to protect telomeres from DNA repair mechanisms (PMID: 28393832).	true

POU3F2 encodes for a class III POU-homeodomain transcription factor that functions primarily in neuronal differentiation (PMID: 8543155, 10842361). POU3F2 is a core regulator of neural gene networks that have been implicated in risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (PMID: 30545964, 32929213). POU3F2 is required for the generation of tuft cells, which are chemosensory cells found in gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts that respond to external stimuli by releasing bioactive material to regulate immune cell function (PMID: 26675736, 29216297). Overexpression of POU3F2 in various types of cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation, invasion and migration and confers radioresistance, suggesting that POU3F2 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 36797433, 32169117, 23358112, 27784708, 31920461).

POU3F4, a member of the POU-III family, encodes for a transcription factor that functions primarily in early neural development, including neural tube and hypothalamic patterning (PMID: 1628619). POU3F4 is located on the X chromosome, and mutations in this gene have been associated with X chromosome-linked hearing loss due to its function in middle and inner ear development (PMID: 33919129, 36000053). Overexpression of POU3F4 in various cancer cell lines and models induces increased cellular proliferation, migration and viability, suggesting that POU3F4 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 31371344, 25243889, 25343275, 19307926).

PPARG encodes the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor- gamma (PPAR- Î³) subfamily of nuclear receptors. PPAR-Î³ forms a heterodimer with Retinoid X Receptor-Î± in response to peroxisome proliferators such as clofibric acid or to RXR-Î± agonists such as 9-cis-retinoic acid and activates the expression of various genes involved in the regulation of adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, atherogenesis, inflammation and tumor susceptibility (PMID: 1324435, 8536636). Chromosomal translocation (2;3)(q13;p25) resulting in a fusion between DNA binding domains of thyroid transcription factor Paired box gene 8 (PAX8) and PPAR- Î³1 has been identified in a subset of thyroid follicular carcinomas (PMID: 10958784). PAX8-PPAR-Î³ behaves like an oncoprotein, and its transforming properties can be attributed at least in part to a dominant negative inhibition of wildtype PPAR-Î³ (PMID: 15077183). Ligands that activate PPAR-Î³, typically thiazolidinediones, are known to sensitize a wide array of cancer cells to death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis, owing to de novo expression of proteins involved in regulating the cell cycle and cell survival/death, and also act as inhibitors of angiogenesis (PMID: 18615184,15041792). On the contrary, PPAR-Î³ agonists have also been reported to increase the frequency and size of colon tumors in APCMin/+ mouse models of colon cancer (PMID: 9734399, 9734400).	false

PPM1D (Protein Phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent, 1D) is a member of the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. PPM1D is induced by p53 following activation in response to various environmental stresses such as radiation, H2O2, and anisomycin (PMID: 19015127, 22201816). PPM1D is emerging as an important oncogene by virtue of its negative control on several key tumor suppressor pathways including ATM, CHK2, p38 MAPK, and p53 (PMID: 19879149). PPM1D is overexpressed and/or mutated in various human primary cancers, including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian carcinoma and neuroblastoma (PMID: 19879149, 23242139, 17233815, 19293255). High PPM1D expression has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and prostate cancer (PMID: 25412952, 25060857, 26714478). Finally, various PPM1D inhibitors, including peptidic inhibitors derived from substrate sequences and small chemical inhibitors, were reported that suppress cancer cell growth and could be useful in the development of effective anti-cancer agents (PMID: 18845566, 21528848, 17073441, 24390428, 22115592, 25466181, 26358280).	false

PPP2R1A is frequently mutated in endometrial and ovarian cancers.	The PPP2R1A gene encodes protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in cell growth and division (PMID: 11171037). PP2A activity has long been considered an important tumor suppressor (PMID: 2153055), although recent evidence suggests that it may function as an oncogene in some context (PMID: 27272709). The PPP2R1A gene encodes the 'scaffolding' subunit of the PP2A trimeric holoenzyme, so named because it bridges PP2A's catalytic subunit to a myriad of targeting subunits (PMID: 17055435). Targeting subunits confer specificity for substrate selection and enzyme localization in the cell. PPP2R1A mutations have recently been found to positively correlate with whole-genome doublings in human cancers (PMID: 24071852). These mutations have been identified in uterine (endometrial) carcinomas (PMID: 23636398, 21435433, 21381030, 21435433), uterine (serous) carcinomas (PMID: 21435433) , ovarian low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous carcinomas (PMID: 21435433, 20826764, 21381030).

PPP2R2A (also PR55Î±) is a subunit of the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) that is a member of the PP2A regulatory B subunit family (PMID: 18588945). PP2A is a trimeric enzyme, which is composed of a catalytic subunit, a scaffold subunit, and one of 18 regulatory subunits, such as PPP2R2A, functioning as the predominant serine/threonine phosphatase (PMID: 18588945). PPP2R2A binding contributes to the selectivity of the PP2A phosphatase for substrates (PMID: 18588945, 18042541). Oncogenes, such as MYC and AKT, are negatively regulated by PPP2R2A activity (PMID: 32522823). Dephosphorylation of these targets results in altered cellular functions including reduced proliferation and cellular survival (PMID: 18042541, 12932319). In addition, PPP2R2A regulates ATM dephosphorylation, leading to homologous recombination at sites of DNA damage in the genome (PMID: 23087057). PPP2R2A has additional protein targets including AP-1, HDAC4, and TFGBR1, among others (PMID: 18158287, 12912990, 18045992, 12932319, 14712210, 9774674). Somatic PPP2R2A loss-of-function mutations and deletions have been reported in many cancer types, including prostate, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers (PMID: 21872824, 23087057, 25879784, 31349904, 27531894), and are predictive or poor survival (PMID: 32522823, 25879784, 31822657, 26893480, 25879784). In loss-of-function preclinical studies, PPP2R2A deletion corresponded to increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, such as ATR, CHK1, and PARP1 inhibitors, due to elevation of replication stress pathways (PMID: 32522823, 23087057).	true

PPP4R2 may be instrumental in targeting PPP4 catalytic subunit (PPP4c) to the centrosomes, and may also regulate (inhibit) the activity of PPP4c at centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (PMID: 10769191). PPP4R2 interacts with Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) protein complex and is essential for differentiation of neuronal cells (PMID: 22559936) as well as for temporal localization of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), suggesting a role in maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs (PMID: 12668731). PPP4R2 is part of a conserved ternary complex including PPP4R3 and PPP4c that mediates dephosphorylation of RPA2 and Î³H2AX, and is required for DNA double strand break repair (PMID: 18614045, 20154705).	false

Aberrant expression of PPP6C is found in melanomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, mesotheliomas and glioblastomas.	The PPP6C gene encodes the catalytic subunit of serine/threonine phosphatase 6 (PP6) (PMID: 9143513), which integrates signaling from multiple pathways. In normal cells, PP6 regulates cell cycle progression, and hence restricts G1 to S phase progression in cancer cells (PMID: 9013334, 21187329, 10227379). PP6 plays an important role in oocyte meiosis, and loss of PP6 protein is associated with female infertility (PMID: 26349807). In addition, PP6 is involved in the homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation; it also plays an important role in inflammatory responses by IL-1 via dephosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop of TAK1 (PMID: 21451261, 17079228). PP6 has been shown to promote replication of influenza A virus (PMID: 25187537). PP6âs involvement in cancer has been largely established. Somatic mutations that lead to inactivation of the protein, loss of heterozygosity and nonsense mutations are observed in approximately 10% of melanomas harboring NRAS or BRAF mutations; these mutations are associated with poor prognosis (PMID: 24336958, 22842228, 24755198, 23729733, 22817889). Overexpression of PPP6C in glioblastoma is associated with worse overall survival (PMID: 25332711, 22395973); downregulation of PP6, which is dependent on miR-373, is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma and mesothelioma (PMID: 21481188, 20463022).

PREX2 can activate the PI3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway by antagonizing PTEN inhibitory effects (PMID: 19729658); conversely, PTEN negatively regulates PREX2-mediated oncogenic effects (PMID: 25829446). PREX2 activation increases cell proliferation, activates PI3K signaling and downregulates tumor suppressors such as CDKN1C in NRAS-mutant melanoma (PMID: 25829446, 26884185).

PRKACA, a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), is involved in the phosphorylation of many cellular proteins important for cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis. Cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-dependent activation of PKA leads to the release of PKA regulatory subunits and subsequent phosphorylation of a number of downstream substrates. Cellular substrates of PKA, including transcription factors such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), are involved in the activation of multiple downstream processes, typically those involved in cellular metabolism.

Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit PRKAR1A releases the catalytic subunits of PKA to phosphorylate target proteins, resulting in the activation of signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, cell division and invasion (PMID: 26042218, 27995993). Germline mutations in PRKAR1A are responsible for the Carney complex disorder characterized by skin pigmented lesions, myxomas, collagenomas and fibromas (PMID: 10973256) and for primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease leading to Cushing's syndrome (PMID: 17036196, 12424709). Deletions and loss-of-function mutations in PRKAR1A have been identified in adrenocortical tumors (PMID: 14500362).

PRKD1 has also been implicated in VEGF-induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells (PMID: 18332134) and in the KRAS-mediated methylator phenotype of colorectal cancers (PMID: 24623306). The PRKD1 gene is mutated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and salivary gland adenocarcinomas (PMID: 25240283, 25303977). Small molecule inhibitors against PRKD1 and other protein kinase D isoforms are available (PMID: 20442301).	false

PRKN is inactivated in various cancer types, and its dysfunction is associated with hereditary Parkinson's disease.	PRKN encodes the parkin protein, which is a component of an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex that serves to mark proteins for proteasomal degradation (PMID: 19946270, 24793136). The PRKN protein functions through physical interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, including UBCH7 and UBCH7 (PMID:19946270). Through regulation of protein stability, PRKN plays a role in several molecular processes which contribute to oncogenesis, including but not limited to cell cycle progression (PMID:24793136), mitochondrial homeostasis (PMID: 25815004, 24149988) and apoptosis (PMID: 19679562). PRKN is frequently deleted across a variety of cancer types (PMID: 24793136, 24297497, 19946270); however, other forms of PRKN inactivation, including somatic mutation and promoter hypermethylation/down-regulation of expression, have also been observed (PMID: 24297497; cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov. 2015). Recently, germline mutation in PRKN has been associated with familial lung cancer (PMID: 25640678).	true

PRPF8 encodes the core component of the catalytic U2- and U12-dependent spliceosome complexes. PRPF8 contains several WD domains throughout the protein that allow for protein-protein interactions to mediate the assembly of spliceosomal proteins, snRNAs and pre-mRNA splicing (PMID: 9774689). Alternative splicing of PRPF8 has been identified in various different cancers and results in dysfunction of the proofreading function when assembling spliceosome complexes (PMID: 24781015, 32547101, 35124606). PRPF8 is located close to the TP53 locus on chromosome 17p, and alternative splicing mutations of PRPF8 have been identified in cancer concomitantly with TP53 loss-of-function mutations (PMID: 24781015).	true

Mutations in PRSS1 are associated with pancreatitis and increased risk of pancreatic cancer.	PRSS1 encodes cationic trypsinogen which is secreted in the pancreas, making up about two-thirds of the trypsin content in normal pancreatic juice. Cationic trypsinogen is typically activated in the small intestine to become the digestive enzyme trypsin-1. Trypsin-1 cleaves peptide linkages involving the carboxyl group of lysine or arginine (PMID: 16791840, 7845208, 25010489). It is part of a family of serine protease enzymes that perform a wide variety of functions including immune response, digestion, blood coagulation and reproduction (PMID 12475199). Germline mutations in PRSS1 are associated with premature activation of trypsin-1 causing pancreatic self-digestion that results in pancreatitis and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (PMID: 23187834, 25479140). Missense mutations in PRSS1 are relatively common in some other solid tumors, including melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Mar. 2016).	false

PSMB2 is a non-catalytic beta subunit of the 20S core proteasome complex (PMID: 15244466). The proteasome complex maintains protein homeostasis through the degradation of intracellular proteins (PMID: 15244466). PSMB2, along with the other six beta subunits, form the proteasome complex's proteolytic chamber through the assembly of two heptameric rings (PMID: 12015144). Overexpression of PSMB2 promotes tumorigenesis through decreasing homologous recombination, impairing DNA double-strand break repair, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (PMID: 21660142, 36110152). In vitro knockdown of PSMB2 in cell lines suppresses proteasome complex activity and cell proliferation, and promotes apoptosis (PMID: 36110152). High levels of PSMB2 have been identified in a variety of tumor types including chronic leukemia, liver cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 32933107, 29780166).	false

PTCH1 (protein patched homolog 1) encodes a transmembrane protein that is a component of the oncogenic Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. PTCH1 functions as the primary receptor for sonic hedgehog (SHH), a secreted protein involved in embryonic development (PMID: 11001584, 8906787). In response to SHH, PTCH1 binds and inhibits Smoothened (SMO), a G protein-coupled receptor; this results in decreased signaling via the HH pathway (PMID: 14737121). Thus, PTCH1 functions as a classic tumor suppressor by inhibiting SMO-mediated oncogenic signaling. Germline PTCH1 mutations are associated with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS, Gorlin syndrome), which predisposes patients to basal cell carcinoma as well as medulloblastoma (PMID: 8658145). Recurrent somatic inactivating PTCH1 mutations have been identified in basal cell carcinoma (PMID: 26950094) and medulloblastoma, suggesting that mutant PTCH1 is a primary driver of these diseases (PMID: 21107850, 22832583, 24651015, 22820256, 21163964, 22832581). As inactivating PTCH1 mutations lead to increased SMO activity recently developed SMO inhibitors show promising responses in PTCH1 mutant tumors (PMID: 24651015, 26169613).	true

PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer (PMID: 9072974, 9090379, 22473468). PTEN has several physiological functions, most notably operating as a phosphatase that converts phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-diphosphate (PIP2) at the cell membrane (PMID: 18767981). Impairment of PTEN function through multiple mechanisms, including through non-synonymous mutations, results in PIP3 accumulation and constitutive activation of catabolic downstream AKT/mTOR signaling. Therefore, PTEN inactivation promotes cell growth, proliferation and survival (PMID: 12040186). Additionally, nuclear PTEN is thought to regulate RAD51 expression, and in this way is also associated with homologous recombination and repair of DNA strand breaks (PMID: 17218262, 23888040). Thus, loss of PTEN may also lead to greater genomic instability and provide a setting for the accumulation of other deleterious mutations. PTEN is frequently mutated in many types of human cancers (PMID: 15254063). Germline loss-of-function PTEN mutations occur in approximately 80% of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome Cowden disease, which is associated with high-penetrance breast and thyroid cancer (PMID: 9467011, 24136893, 21430697).	true

The PTP4A1 gene encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) with a characteristic PTP domain that is necessary to dephosphorylate its substrates, and a prenylation domain that allows the protein to bind the plasma membrane (PMID: 9018080, 15571731). PRP4A1 forms part of the mitotic spindle and stimulates progression from G1 to S phases during mitosis, probably via negative regulation of the p21 tumor suppressor (PMID: 12235145, 14643450). PTP4A1 enhances cell migration, invasion and metastasis by activating SRC and ERK pathways (PMID: 12782572, 19199380,). THE PTP4A1 gene is rarely altered in human tumors, only being amplified in a small subset of tumors such as prostate cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016).	false

PTPN1 (also PTP1B) is a tyrosine phosphatase that functions as a signaling protein. PTPN1 is implicated as a negative regulator of the insulin pathway and removes phosphat molecules from activated insulin receptor kinase (PMID: 11884589). In addition, PTPN1 regulates the activity of a variety of other kinases implicated in a variety of cellular contexts including EGFR (PMID: 9050838), JAK2 (PMID: 11694501), TYK2 (PMID: 11694501), and FAK (PMID: 16291744), among others. PTPN1 activity has been associated with the regulation of several cellular processes including invasion (PMID: 18332219), cytokine sensitivity (PMID: 26817397), cell adhesion (PMID: 10409197), and proliferation (PMID: 14766979). Loss of PTPN1 in preclinical studies leads to increased JAK-STAT pathway activity in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 24531327) and deletion of PTPN1 in mice results in a hematopoietic malignancy (PMID: 28111468). Somatic mutations in PTPN1 have been identified in lymphomas including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and Hodgkinâs lymphoma (PMID: 29650799, 24531327). PTPN1 alterations are largely loss-of-function mutations that are associated with reduced PTPN1 protein expression and phosphatase activity, suggesting that PTPN1 functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 24531327). However, overexpression of PTPN1 truncation and splice mutations in cell lines results in transformation, implicating some alterations as dominant negative mutations (PMID: 27855221). In addition, the PTPN1 gene lies within the 20q region that is frequently deleted in myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes (PMID: 7949181) and amplified in breast and ovarian cancers (PMID: 8758909, 10815905).

PTPN11 (also known as SHP2) is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that removes phosphate groups from signaling molecules (PMID: 18286234). In its resting inactive state, PTPN11 maintains a conformation that inhibits phosphatase activity (PMID: 18286234). After growth factor or cytokine stimulation of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), PTPN11 is recruited to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the RTK leading to a conformational change and activation of phosphatase activity (PMID: 18286234, 21575863). PTPN11 regulates multiple signaling cascades and is involved in the negative regulation of the PI3K/AKT (PMID: 14644997), STAT5 (PMID: 23103841) and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways (PMID: 25026279, 24618081). Germline mutations in PTPN11 have been identified in Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome, while somatic PTPN11 mutations have been identified in several cancers and are prevalent in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (PMID: 11704759,16358218). PTPN11 mutations typically occur as missense mutations that disrupt phosphatase activity or have dominant negative function, leading to the activation of signaling pathways that regulate growth (PMID: 21575863). However, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations can lead to pathway activation, as the open conformation of PTPN11 resulting from mutation matters more for its interaction with other proteins than does its catalytic activity (PMID: 29559584). KRAS-mediated tumorigenesis has been shown to depend on functional PTPN11 protein (PMID: 29808010, 29808006, 29808009).While PTPN11-specific therapies have not yet been developed, small molecule inhibitors targeting members of the RAF and PI3K signaling pathways have been found to be therapeutically effective in the context of PTPN11 loss (PMID: 26365186).	false

PTPN13, a member of the PTP family, encodes for a tyrosine phosphatase that functions in apoptotic regulation (PMID: 15611135). PTPN13 interacts with FAS and NGFR through its phosphotyrosine substrate recognition pocket to negatively regulate pro-apoptotic signaling (PMID: 7536343, 20620960). PTPN13 functions in the regulation of various other cellular physiological processes, including cell-cell adhesion and cellular proliferation, by regulating phosphorylation levels of signaling pathways such as Akt and PI3K (PMID: 32919955, 23604317). Knockdown of PTPN13 in various cancer cell lines and models reduces cell-cell junction stability and cell-cell adhesion, tumor growth and invasiveness, and colony formation and invasion, suggesting that PTPN13 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 31938048, 20501847, 17982484). Downregulation of PTPN13 has been identified in various types of cancer, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (PMID: 20501847, 22245727, 32919955).

PTPN2 (also TC-PTP) is a tyrosine phosphatase that functions as a signaling protein. PTPN2 is highly expressed in immune cells and functions to remove phosphate molecules from proteins, namely protein tyrosine kinases (PMID: 19290937). Many substrates of PTPN2 have been identified including JAK1 (PMID: 11909529), JAK3 (PMID: 11909529), STAT1/6 (PMID: 12138178, 17210636), EGFR (PMID: 11514572, 9488479), and the oncogenic fusion BCR-ABL (PMID: 14966296), among others. Predominantly, PTPN2-mediated dephosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases results in negative regulation of downstream signaling pathways (PMID: 11514572). PTPN2 can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, which is dependent on numerous factors including the presence of cellular stress (PMID: 11479308). Activity of PTPN2 is required for a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle control (PMID: 11498795), lymphocytic proliferation (PMID: 12847239), lymphocytic lineage specification (PMID: 28798028), insulin signaling (PMID: 20484139), apoptosis (PMID: 21984578) and cytokine sensitivity (PMID: 21115548). PTPN2 also negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling, leading to attenuation of immune responses (PMID: 22080863). Loss of PTPN2 expression in mice results in hematopoietic deficiencies and dysregulation of inflammatory responses (PMID: 9271584, 29444435). Polymorphisms in PTPN2 are associated with autoimmune disorders such as Crohnâs disease, type I diabetes and ulcerative colitis (PMID: 22080863, 22457781, 24445916). Deletions and somatic loss-of-function mutations in PTPN2 have been identified in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PMID: 20473312, 21551237, 21791476). In contrast, PTPN2 expression has been associated with colon cancer promotion due to reduced inflammasome activity (PMID: 29444435). Consistent with this result, deletion of PTPN2 leads to enhanced efficacy of immunotherapies as evidenced in preclinical studies by an activated inflammatory response (PMID: 28723893).	true

Additionally, PTPRS is considered a member of the leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) subfamily of PTPs, due to its role in development of the nervous system and evolutionary conservation (PMID: 15674434). PTPRS is seldom altered in cancer but its deregulation has been observed in several cancers, such as colorectal, head and neck and ovarian tumors, and it might act as a tumor suppressor through regulation of angiogenic and EMT processes (PMID: 16557282, 25998839, 26308964, 22065749).	true

RAB35 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that collectively function in regulating the myriad of membrane transport processes in eukaryotic cells (PMID: 19931531, 20937701, 23060965). RAB35 (also named Ray or Rab1c), interacts with p53-related protein kinase and distributes in the nucleus, cytosol, and cell membrane (PMID: 16600182). RAB35 is an interacting partner for nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) in human lymphoma cells (PMID:14968112) and mediates Wnt5a-induced migration of breast cancer cells (PMID:23353182). Through mutual antagonism, RAB35 and ARF6 are geared to reciprocally balance the recycling of integrins and cadherins in order to tune cell adhesive behavior towards cell migration or intercellular contact. Consistent with that, there is a strong reduction in RAB35 expression levels in brain, breast and squamous tumors, which are all associated with EGF receptor overexpression and enhanced ARF6 activity (PMID: 23264734). A clinical investigation demonstrates a significant positive correlation between RAB35 and androgen receptor (AR) expression in ovarian cancer, making RAB35 attractive as a candidate for biomarker of AR function in ovarian cancer (PMID:19623182). Importantly, RAB35 is a critical regulator of PI3K-AKT signaling that acts upstream of PDK1 and mTORC2 and downstream of growth factor receptors (PMID:26338797). Expression of two known cancer-related RAB35 missense mutations, RAB35-A151T or RAB35-F161L, resulted in increased AKT phosphorylation, enhanced cell viability, resistance to apoptosis under growth-factor deprivation, and PI3K-dependent transformation, indicative of a gain-of-function effect (PMID: 26338797). Searches of existing human tumor sequencing databases reveal that RAB35 mutations are rare and are therefore unlikely to appear on current lists of human cancer genes that rely solely on statistical methods to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations (PMID: 26338797). Finally, RAB35 is a target gene of miR-720 in HEK293T and HeLa cells, a nonclassical miRNA involved in the initiation and progression of several tumors (PMID:26413265).	false

The RAC1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1) gene encodes a member of the Rho family of GTPases, which includes RHO, RAC1 and CDC42. Rho GTPases regulate the assembly and disassembly of the cytoskeleton; in this regard, RAC1 plays a role in cell adhesion, differentiation and migration (PMID: 24072884, 17373658). Additionally, RAC1 is involved in pathways governing proliferation (MAPK pathway), the inflammatory response (NFkB pathway) and regulation of the cell cycle (PMID: 24072884, 10816416, 17373658). The activity of RAC1 is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which switch GDP for GTP and trigger catalysis of GTP to GDP, respectively (PMID: 10816416). RAC1 is ubiquitously expressed, and gain-of-function mutations are implicated in processes underlying metastasis and drug-resistance; therefore, RAC1 is a putative drug target (PMID: 22407364, 25056119, 19509242, 24072884, 25594058, 24750242).

RAC2 encodes a small signaling GTPase protein Rac2 (Ras-relatedC3 botulinum toxin substrate 2) belonging to the Rac sub-family of Rho family of GTPases. RAC2 regulates various cellular processes such as secretion, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell polarization (specifically lamellipodial extension and membrane ruffling), and phagocytosis (PMID: 16949823). RAC2 has been identified as a component of the phagocytic oxidase complex in neutrophils, and a dominant negative mutation (D57N) in RAC2is associated with phagocyte immunodeficiency in humans (PMID: 10961859, 15814684, 21167572). In addition, RAC2 is involved in multiple kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling networks (PMID: 7664330, 9042860, 10843388). Unlike RAC1 and RAC3, RAC2 is expressed specifically in cells of hematopoietic lineages (PMID: 23850828, 12370311), and RAC2-deficient mice demonstrate cellular defects in multiple hematopoietic lineages, including stem and progenitor cells, neutrophils, mast cells, T and B cells (PMID:12370311, 11057896, 11320224). Mouse models have revealed a distinct role for RAC2 in promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis (PMID: 24770346) and loss of RAC2 causes a significant delay in the development of BCR-ABL-driven myeloproliferative disorders (PMID: 17996650).	false

RAD17 is a cell cycle checkpoint chromatin-binding protein that functions as a regulator of cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair in response to DNA damage (PMID: 20424596). When DNA damage occurs in cells, RAD17 is phosphorylated at two conserved serine motifs on its C-terminus by ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases (PMID: 11418864). Phosphorylated RAD17 in turn recruits and activates Claspin to phosphorylate CHK1 to halt mitotic entry and mediate DNA repair and replication (PMID: 16885023, 11090622, 11390642). Loss of RAD17 function promotes tumorigenesis through increased chromosomal aberrations, DNA double-strand breaks and endoreduplication, significantly reducing cell viability (PMID: 12672690). Loss of RAD17 has been frequently identified in various cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma (PMID: 17657792, 26437225).	true

Germline mutations of RAD21 are associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.	RAD21 is a subunit of the cohesin complex that aligns and stabilizes sister chromatids during metaphase (PMID: 24854081). The cohesin ring is comprised of two large structural proteins, SMC1a and SMC3, and this ring opens and closes through the binding of alpha-kleisin subunits to the RAD21 adapter protein (PMID: 24854081). The cohesin complex also functions to maintain chromatin looping structures, or 3D arrangements of DNA that allow for regulatory control of gene expression (PMID: 28985562). RAD21 has been implicated as a double-stranded break DNA repair protein (PMID: 20711430). Germline mutations in RAD21 have been identified in patients with cohesinopathies leading to a spectrum of developmental defects (PMID: 22633399). Somatic RAD21 mutations have been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (PMID: 24335498, 23955599, 25006131). RAD21 mutations are predominantly missense and predicted to lead to loss of function activity, however, it remains unclear if RAD21 mutations lead to aneuploidy as predicted (PMID: 25006131).	true

Select germline mutations of RAD50 predispose to breast cancer.	RAD50 is a subunit of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex. The MRN complex is recruited to the site of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as part of the DNA damage response (DDR) and plays a pivotal role in the repair of damage via either the homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways (PMID: 2659437, 15309560). Within this complex, RAD50 functions as a flexible and dynamic dimer with ATPase activity. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that RAD50 functions in the maintenance of genomic integrity via the bridging of multiple RAD50 molecules to DNA and subsequent recruitment of the MRN complex to damaged chromatin (PMID: 21458667, 21511873, 21441914, 12152085, 25576492). RAD50 also has a direct function in bridging the ends of DNA that are to be repaired via NHEJ (PMID: 15309560). Germline mutations in RAD50 have been identified in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome-like disorder, characterized by progressive microcephaly, short stature and increased risk of cancer (PMID: 19409520). Mutations in RAD50 increase tumor susceptibility, similar to mutations in other DNA repair enzymes, and RAD50 somatic mutations have been identified in several human cancers (PMID: 16385572, 24894818). RAD50 mutations are predicted to be loss-of-function leading to the reduced ability for DNA damage-induced MRN foci to form (PMID: 19409520).	true

RAD51 is a member of the RAD51 recombinase family that functions in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). RAD51 acts at an early step in the DSB pathway: the 5âended DNA strands flanking the DSB break site are resected and the single-stranded overhangs are coated by RAD51 forming a nucleo-protein filament (PMID: 25833843). RAD51 then probes for homologous DNA and initiates the process of strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA (PMID: 19122145, 20930833). RAD51 forms protein complexes with known tumor suppressors including BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2; specifically, BRCA2 loads RAD51 monomers at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (PMID: 14636569, 20729832, 20930833, 20871615, 20729858). RAD51 germline mutations may increase breast cancer risk in certain populations (PMID: 10807537, 26108708), while other studies suggest the RAD51 135 G/C single nucleotide polymorphism may increase breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers (PMID: 11248061, 17999359). RAD51 is infrequently mutated in human cancer; however, RAD51 overexpression has been linked to increased oncogenic potential in several tumor types, including pancreatic and breast (PMID: 18243065, 24811120, 26317153, 21807066, 10851081).	true

RAD51 then probes for homologous DNA and initiates the process of strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA (PMID: 19122145, 20930833). RAD51B expression is upregulated following ionizing radiation (PMID: 9788630) and RAD51B function is required for the formation of repair complexes including RAD51 paralogs, XRCC2 and XRCC3 (PMID:11751635, 11283264, 10938124). In addition to the DNA damage repair pathway, RAD51B has been shown to influence cell cycle regulation through phosphorylation of p53, CDK2 and cyclin E, resulting in G1 cell cycle delay (PMID: 10623463). Germline RAD51B variants have been identified as risk factors in familial breast cancer (PMID: 27149063, 21852249, 23001122, 24325915, 25779941, 21852249) and glioblastoma (PMID: 22017238).

RAD51C is a component of two DSB repair complexes, BCDX2 (including RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and XRCC2) and CX3 (including XRCC3), which have roles in damage-stabilization and assembly of RAD51 filaments, respectively (PMID: 16093548, 23149936). RAD51C activity is also important for resolving Holliday junctions (PMID: 17114795, 14716019). Biallelic germline mutations of RAD51C are associated with a Fanconi anemia-like disorder (PMID: 20400963) characterized by developmental defects and predisposition to cancer. In addition, germline mutations in RAD51C confer susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer (PMID: 20400964, 21616938, 21990120, 22538716), as well as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 24315737).	true

RAD52 is a recombinase protein involved in RAD51-mediated DNA recombination and repair (PMID: 27649245). RAD52 binds to RAD51, promoting strand exchange during homologous recombination (HR) by pairing of homologous single- and double-stranded DNA (PMID: 27649245). Biochemical studies suggest RAD52 may help recruit RAD51 to double-stranded break (DSB) loci or form RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments (PMID: 10212258, 8550550, 9450758, 8370524). Whereas RAD51 knockout is embryonic lethal in mice, depletion of RAD52 in mice or human cell lines does not render a lethal or DSB-sensitive phenotype (PMID: 9774659, 8943369, 8692798). However, preclinical studies show that inactivation of RAD52 in cells lacking BRCA2, BRCA1, RAD51 paralogs or PALB2 results in synthetic lethality (PMID: 9774659, 22964643, 23071261) indicating that RAD52 has redundant function in RAD51-mediated HR repair pathways (PMID: 22964643, 23071261).

RAD54L is a member of the SNF2-family of helicases that functions as a chromatin remodeling protein for the repair of double-stranded breaks during homologous recombination and repair (PMID: 17417655, 19671661). RAD54L binds to RAD51, the central homologous repair protein, and facilities a topological change in the DNA leading to DNA pairing and recombination (PMID: 11030338, 12359723). The RAD54L-RAD51 interaction results in supercoiling ahead of replication factor complex movement and the stabilization of the D loops during DNA repair (PMID: 11459989, 16818238). RAD51 binding to single and double-stranded DNA is stabilized by RAD54L during recombination initiation (PMID: 12566442). There is additional evidence that RAD54L can disassociate RAD51 from duplex DNA after recombination has been initiated (PMID: 12453424).

Germline mutations of RAF1 are associated with Noonan and LEOPARD syndrome.	RAF1, or CRAF, is one of three RAF serine/threonine kinases that signal in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PMID: 17555829). In response to extracellular stimuli, RAS-mediated signaling induces the formation of CRAF homodimers or CRAF/BRAF heterodimers leading to phosphorylation of MEK and subsequently ERK, which are signaling effectors in the MAPK pathway. Activation of MAPK signaling stimulates a wide range of cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation and migration (PMID: 21779496). CRAF is ubiquitously expressed and is necessary for normal physiology in several tissues despite partially overlapping functions with ARAF and BRAF (PMID: 9767153). Somatic mutations in RAF1 occur at a low frequency in different cancers, including uterine, stomach, colorectal and malignant melanoma (PMID: 27273450, 24957944). Several RAF1 missense mutations have been shown to be oncogenic, leading to increased MAPK signaling and oncogenic transformation in vitro (PMID: 24569458). Additionally, rare oncogenic RAF1 fusions have been found in different types of cancer (PMID: 19363522, 20526349, 25266736).

RARA (retinoic acid receptor alpha) is a transcription factor that plays a role in the differentiation of white blood cells. RARA heterodimerizes with the RXR nuclear receptor and is activated by binding retinoid ligands (PMID: 1310350). Binding of the ligand results in a conformational change and recruits histone acetyltransferases and chromatin remodeling ATPases that activate transcription (PMID: 8274399, 11106744). RARA signaling is involved in the development of multiple tissue types, hematopoiesis, and stem cell specification (PMID: 9053308, 10529422, 24074870). Translocations between RARA and PML is implicated in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (PMID: 23841729). The fusion protein confers sensitivity to targeted treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide (PMID: 20378816).

RASA1 (Ras p21 protein activator 1) encodes a RAS GAP also known as p120RasGAP (PMID: 3201259). It accelerates the conversion of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP to terminate Ras signaling (PMID: 17540168, 18568040). The absence of RASA1 activity leads to accumulation of GTP-bound RAS and persistent MAP kinase signaling following growth factor stimulation (PMID: 9121432). Somatic alterations in RASA1 map to all regions of the gene, including the C-terminal GAP catalytic domain and the N-terminal tandem SH2-SH3-SH2-PH-C2 domains. The SH2 and SH3 domains have been shown to interact with signaling proteins, including RhoGaps. Statistical analysis of mutational profiles of more than 8,200 tumor data sets identified RASA1 as a candidate driver and a putative tumor-suppressor gene based on a high ratio of inactivating to benign mutations (PMID: 24183448). RASA1 has also been implicated as a potential tumor suppressor in aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and several subtypes of breast cancer (PMID: 25303977, 16570289, 19372580). The highest rates of RASA1 mutations have been reported for prostate adenocarcinoma (13.1%) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (13%) (PMID: 22722839, 25303977). In most cancers somatic alterations in RASA1 are infrequent (e.g. 1.6% across 21 tumor types) (PMID: 24390350). RASA1 plays an essential role in vascular system development, as loss-of-function mutations cause capillary âmalformation-arteriovenousâ malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) (PMID: 24038909, 22913934).	true

RB1, also known as RB, is involved in the cell-cycle checkpoint and in its active form inhibits the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle until the cell is ready to divide. RB is active in its unphosphorylated form where it binds to E2F family of transcription factors, which together with the E2F Dimerization Partner (E2F-DP), inhibits the transcription of S-phase promoting factors by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and induce heterochromatin formation (PMID: 1655277). At the end of G1, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate RB to pRB which leads to its dissociation from the E2F-DP complex, thereby allowing entry into S-phase. RB remains phosphorylated until the end of mitosis at which point it is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to activate the G1-S-phase checkpoint (PMID: 20694007). In addition to its role in G1 cell cycle arrest, RB1 has also been shown to play a role in safeguarding genome stability and mediating apoptosis, senescence and differentiation in response to various stimuli (PMID: 22293180). As a result of its role in these essential cellular functions, loss of function of RB1 not only leads to unregulated cell division and growth but also to the abrogation of multiple mechanisms that safeguard against cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Loss-of-function and deletions of RB1 have been associated with many human cancers including lung, breast, prostate and bladder cancers, and concomitant loss of RB1 and p53 are thought to constitute a tumor-initiating event (PMID: 12204530). Homozygous loss or inactivation of the RB1 gene is a hallmark of retinoblastoma (PMID: 22293180), and germline mutations in RB1 and are at an increased risk of retinoblastoma as well as other cancer types (22205104).	true

RBM15 binds pre-messenger RNA at introns of important hematopoietic genes, including GATA1, MPL, and RUNX1, and recruits splicing factors to mediate alternative splicing (PMID: 26575292, 25468569). In addition, RBM15 is important in the nuclear export of mRNA via binding to the nuclear receptor NFX1, leading to nuclear envelope localization in order to coordinate messenger ribonucleoprotein binding (PMID: 17001072, 18981216, 19586903, 19786495). RBM15 is also important in the regulation of several cellular functions including X chromosome inactivation, cell fate specification, DNA damage and cellular proliferation (PMID: 26190105). RBM15 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and RBM15 expression restricts the development of myeloid and megakaryocytic cell types (PMID: 17283045). In addition, RBM15 coordinately regulates differentiation in a cell-type specific manner with NOTCH transcriptional activity (PMID: 17283045). Loss of RBM15 expression in murine models results in hematopoietic abnormalities including loss of peripheral B cells and a shift towards myeloid progenitor fate (PMID: 17376872). Recurrent RBM15 translocations are found in patients with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (PMID: 11344311). In addition, somatic loss-of-function mutations in RBM15 have been identified in phyllodes tumors, a benign fibroepithelial neoplasm of the breast (PMID: 29315289).	true	
ENST00000421138	NM_002907.3	ENST00000421138	NM_002907.3	5965	RECQL	false			RECQL, a DNA helicase, is a germline breast cancer susceptibility gene.	The RECQL gene encodes a DNA helicase that localizes to sites of DNA damage where mismatch repair factors are also recruited and unwinds the DNA (PMID: 7961977, 8056767, 15886194). The precise mechanisms of action of RECQL are largely unknown, but it is thought to be required for proper DNA replication, DNA repair and genome homeostasis (PMID: 18074021, 20065033, 15886194, 23095637). Alternative functions for RECQL include a role in telomere maintenance (PMID: 24623817). RECQL has been described to regulate genes that promote cell migration and invasion and inhibit apoptosis (PMID: 25424877, 25483193). The RECQL gene is rarely altered in tumors (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016). Germline mutations in RECQL have been associated with breast cancer susceptibility (PMID: 25915596, 25945795).	true	
ENST00000428558	NM_004260.3	ENST00000617875	NM_004260.4	9401	RECQL4	false			RECQL4 encodes a DNA helicase that is involved in DNA replication and repair. Germline mutations of RECQL4 are associated with Rothmund-Thomson, RAPADILINO and Baller-Gerold syndromes and predispose to osteosarcomas, among other cancers.	RECQL4 appears to function both in single-stranded DNA annealing and double-stranded DNA unwinding and is involved in DNA replication and various types of DNA repair, including double-strand break repair, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair and single strand repair (PMID: 20065033, 20222902, 17320201, 18693251, 16949575, 22508716, 19567405). RECQL4 functions as a tumor suppressor. Inheritance of two compromised alleles leads to Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (RTS), Baller-Gerold Syndrome (BGS), or RAPADILINO syndrome, each a rare syndrome with many overlapping phenotypic features. It has been suggested that the different syndromes are a result of mutations with different effects on the protein product, with certain domains involved in specific pathways (PMID: 20301383, 20113479, 17364146). RTS and RAPADILINO have a cancer predisposition, particularly osteosarcoma. RECQL4 somatic mutations, reported in tumors of numerous tissue types, are found across the gene without any specific hotspot. There is currently no therapy targeted at RECQL4 mutations. Missense mutations make up approximately 69% of all point mutations in RECQL4 in reported tumor samples. These mutations are scattered throughout the gene, include the Sld2 (DNA replicative factor) domain and the conserved RecQ-family helicase domain (PMID: 23238538, 23899764, 20668451, 24332040). Mutations in the Sld2 domain have the potential to affect the initiation of DNA replication (PMID: 25336622). Mutations within the helicase domain may affect the ability of RECQL4 to carry out strand annealing/unwinding functions (PMID: 25336622).	true	
ENST00000295025	NM_002908.2	ENST00000295025	NM_002908.2	5966	REL	true			REL, a transcription factor, is most frequently altered by mutation or amplification in B-cell lymphomas.	REL encodes a transcription factor in the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors regulating immune function (PMID:22405852). It is important for the development of regulatory T-cells, B-cell proliferation and survival, and cytokine production (PMID:19995950,10049356,12646638, 12426000). While normally expressed mainly in lymphocytes, it has also been found expressed in various solid cancer types in an oncogenic role (PMID:18037997, 21933882). Polymorphisms in REL are associated with autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders (PMID:19503088, 20953190, 21425313). REL is most frequently altered by amplifications seen in both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas (PMID: 11433522, 12511414, 11830502). It can also be over expressed in lymphomas through translocation with the immunglobulin loci (PMID:17079453). Mutations that alter REL transactivation activity are rare but have been seen in lymphomas (PMID:17072339,1650444, 11921291). REL promotes lymphoma proliferation and cell survival and inhibitors are in development for lymphoma therapy (PMID:17567982, 26744524).	false	
ENST00000428762	NM_005045.3	ENST00000428762	NM_005045.3	5649	RELN	false			RELN, an extracellular glycoprotein involved in neuronal migration, is altered by mutation in neurological disorders and in solid and hematologic malignancies.	RELN (also Reelin) is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein important in neuronal function (PMID: 27303269). Expression of RELN is highest during brain development and is predominantly secreted from Cajal-Retzius neurons and regions of hypothalamic differentiation (PMID: 9182958). In addition, expression of RELN shifts dramatically postnatally, suggesting different roles of RELN during development and adulthood (PMID: 18477607). Activity of RELN is required for appropriate cell migration, aggregation, synaptic function and dendrite formation (PMID: 27803648). RELN acts as an exogenous ligand that binds the receptors VLDLR and ApoER2, resulting in the phosphorylation of DAB1, a signaling effector molecule (PMID: 27803648). Activation of DAB1 initiates the activity of downstream signaling proteins including PI3K and the Src-family protein Crk (PMID: 18477607). RELN signaling mediates the activity of RAP1-GTP and cofilin, proteins involved in cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton (PMID: 27803648). Loss of RELN in mouse models results in central nervous system defects including aberrant motor coordination, tremors, and altered gait (PMID: 7972007, 7715726). Reduced RELN expression has been implicated in a variety of neurological diseases including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism, among others (PMID: 27092053). Germline RELN mutations are found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorder autosomal recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (PMID: 10973257). Somatic mutations in RELN were identified in patients with T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, adult T-ALL and lung cancers (PMID: 22237106, 25595890, 22980976). Epigenetic silencing of RELN expression via methylation occurs in several cancer types including gastric and hepatocellular cancer (PMID: 19956836, 20734148, 29222813), suggesting that RELN likely functions as a tumor suppressor.	false	
ENST00000309042	NM_001193508.1	ENST00000309042	NM_001193508.1	5978	REST	false			REST, a transcriptional repressor, is altered by mutation in various cancer types. Germline mutations of REST are associated with Wilm's tumor.	REST (also NRSF or RE-1 silencing transcription factor) is a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the KrÃ¼ppel-type zinc-finger transcription factor protein family (PMID: 23414932, 15907476). REST functions to suppress the expression of neuronal genes by binding to neuron-restrictive silencer elements (NRSE) (PMID: 15907476). Epigenetic modifying proteins that facilitate gene repression are recruited to chromatin by REST, including CDYL1, EHMT2, HDACs, and SIN3a, among others, to inhibit neuronal gene expression (PMID: 10491605, 15200951, 28286748, 10734093). REST activity has been implicated in the restriction of neuroendocrine cell fate, including in neuroendocrine tumor types such as small cell lung and prostate cancer (PMID: 28489825, 28256535, 24163104). REST also regulates various cellular functions including stemness, invasion, proliferation, hypoxia, neuronal function and embryonic development (PMID: 28256535, 27531581, 28286748). Germline mutations in REST are associated with Wilmâs tumor, a pediatric cancer that affects the kidney (PMID: 26551668). Epigenetic silencing of REST expression is implicated in neurodegenerative disease and in cancer (PMID: 29351877). Somatic truncating mutations and deletions in REST have been identified in several cancer types, including colorectal cancer, suggesting that REST predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 15960972, 23414932). However, increased REST activity is found in neuronal cancers, such as glioblastomas, medulloblastomas and neuroblastomas, suggesting that REST activity may be context-dependent (PMID: 23414932).	true	
ENST00000355710	NM_020975.4	ENST00000355710	NM_020975.4	5979	RET	true	1		RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is altered by mutation in medullary thyroid cancers and by chromosomal rearrangement in lung cancers, papillary thyroid cancers, and rarely, other solid tumors.	RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds ligands of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family and transmits intracellular signals via the pro-oncogenic mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (PMID: 24561444). RET is normally expressed in the developing embryo, playing a particularly important role in neural and neuroendocrine lineages (PMID: 8306871). In cancer, RET can be activated either through point mutations or gene rearrangements with a variety of translocation partners resulting in constitutively active cytosolic oncoproteins (PMID: 24561444). Heritable activating mutations in RET lead to the highly penetrant familial cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B: medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, multiple mucosal neuromas and intestinal ganglioneuromas, marfanoid habitus) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) (PMID: 15322516). Oncogenic somatic mutations include point mutations and genomic rearrangements of the RET locus leading to inversions or translocations. These have been identified in various cancers including papillary thyroid cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In addition, aberrant expression or activation of wildtype RET correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer and endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer (PMID: 24561444).	false	
ENST00000358835	NM_002912	ENST00000358835	NM_002912	5980	REV3L	true			REV3L, a catalytic component of DNA polymerase zeta involved in translesion DNA synthesis, is frequently altered in cancer.	REV3L, also known as POLZ, encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta and functions in translesion DNA synthesis (PMID: 9618506). The catalytic activity of REV3L requires interaction with the non-catalytic subunit of polymerase zeta, REV7, and the scaffolding protein, REV1, to allow assembly of translesion DNA polymerases at sites of DNA damage (PMID: 22859296). REV3L maintains genomic stability and proliferation of cells in response to DNA damage, however, accumulation of DNA damage occurs as a result of REV3L-mediated proliferation (PMID: 11050391, 12805232). The expression level of REV3L varies in a variety of cancer tissues (PMID: 11115544) and cell lineage plays a large role in dictating the oncogenic function of REV3L alterations. Amplification of REV3L has been identified in various cancers, including glioma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and cervical cancer (PMID: 19289490, 26752104, 18593951). Overexpression of REV3L in cervical cancer cells promotes tumorigenesis as measured by increased cell growth and tumor colony formation (PMID: 25781640). Loss of REV3L has been identified in various cancers, including colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 18622427, 15617831). In vitro studies examining the deletion of REV3L have had conflicting results on the effects on cancer cell growth. REV3L inhibition in HeLa cells demonstrated no effect on tumorigenesis as measured by no alteration in colony growth or survival, however other studies using cervical cancer, lung, breast, mesothelioma and colon tumor cells demonstrated suppressed colony growth (PMID: 20028736, 22028621). Polymorphisms of REV3L resulting in loss of REV3L function have been identified in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and mesothelioma (PMID: 22349819, 21455670, 24956248).	false	
ENST00000262187	NM_005614.3	ENST00000262187	NM_005614.3	6009	RHEB	true			RHEB encodes the protein Ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB), a GTPase that is a direct upstream activator of the mTOR pathway. While RHEB is infrequently mutated in human cancer, it has been shown to be overexpressed in many cancer types, likely due to amplifications and/or post-transcriptional regulation.	RHEB encodes a small GTPase within the RAS superfamily that functions as a molecular switch by activating the mTOR pathway (specifically, mTORC1) when bound to GTP (PMID: 24863881). Specifically, RHEB is thought to enact its activation upon mTORC1 via affecting the substrate affinity of mTORC1 for 4EBP1, a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway, resulting in protein synthesis activation (PMID: 19299511). RHEB is negatively regulated by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) which functionally activates the GTPase activity of RHEB causing exchange of the RHEB-bound GTP for GDP thus preventing RHEB from activating mTORC1 (PMID: 18708577). The TSC1/TSC2 complex is frequently mutated in human cancers, which allows for RHEB-associated upregulation of the mTOR pathway (PMID: 18708577, 15240005). RHEB is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is localized to the lysosomal membrane along with mTORC1 and the TSC1/TSC2 complex (PMID: 24863881, 14614311). Beyond its role in the regulation and activation of the mTORC1 complex, RHEB has been suggested to have multiple other non-canonical functions, including regulation of BRAF, as well as being important in developmental functions (PMID: 24863881, 21412983). RHEB has also been postulated to play a context-dependent role in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy (PMID: 24216995). RHEB is not a commonly mutated gene in human cancer, although hotspot, activating mutations have been discovered within the effector domain in a small number of renal cell carcinomas and endometrial cancers (PMID: 24390350, 24631838, cbioportal March, 2015). RHEB has, however, been shown to be overexpressed in multiple cancer types, including liver, lung, prostate, lymphoma and bladder cancer, and RHEB overexpression has been postulated to be associated with poor outcomes in breast cancers and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 18708577, 18708578, 20388784). This overexpression may result in part from copy number gains (RHEB is located at 7q36) or focal amplifications, which occur in numerous cancer types including ovarian (12%, cbioportal March, 2015). RHEB overexpression has been proposed to be a biomarker for response to mTOR pathway inhibitors (rapalogs), although clinical evidence for this is lacking at this time (PMID: 18708578, 24631838).	false	
ENST00000418115	NM_001664.2	ENST00000418115	NM_001664.2	387	RHOA	true			RHOA, a GTPase, is altered in various solid and hematologic malignancies.	The RHOA gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed small GTPase protein that primarily localizes to the cytoplasm. RHOA cycles between an active, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound, and an inactive, guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound state. Proteins known as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) facilitate activation and inactivation of RHOA respectively. RHOA mediates several cellular functions by activating a number of downstream effectors, including the ROCK-cofilin pathway which stimulates cell motility by causing actin stress fiber formation and contractility (PMID: 25660168). RHOA plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis by mediating invasion of tumor cells, and inhibition of RHOA signaling has shown anti-tumor effect in preclinical models (PMID: 21622195, 25728708, 20364104, 25333508). On the contrary, recent studies have shown that several oncogenic RHOA mutations lead to inactivation of the protein, and RHOA deletion is more common than RHOA amplification in some tumors, suggesting a complex and potentially context-dependent role of RHOA in cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, April. 2015; PMID: 24413737, 24816253).	false

The RICTOR (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) gene encodes a core component of the mTOR complex-2 (mTOR2), which also includes mTOR, mLST8, DEPTOR, PRAS40, SIN1, and PROTOR1/2 (PMID: 20418915 ). RICTOR is an upstream kinase for several AGC kinase family members, including AKT/PKB, PKC (protein kinase C) and SGK1 (serum-glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase-1). In response to growth factors, mTOR2 phosphorylates and activates these kinases to regulate cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation and survival (PMID: 22350330, 15268862, 15718470, 18566586, 18925875, 17141160, 18566587). Included in the mTORC2 targets is AKT, a key component in the pro-oncogenic PI3-kinase signaling pathway that regulates various cellular functions including cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis (PMID: 25505994, 15718470). RICTOR also associates with factors independent of mTOR (PMID: 20832730, 18339839, 18426911), and some of the less well-characterized mTOR-independent functions of RICTOR include regulation of cell morphology, migration and protein degradation (PMID: 21670596). Overexpression of RICTOR is positively associated with tumor progression and poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 25371154), endometrial carcinoma (PMID: 24966915), pituitary adenoma (PMID: 23898069) and gastric cancer (PMID: 26159923). Upregulation of RICTOR is associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastasis, suggesting RICTOR as a potential biomarker for prognosis and stratification of patients with RCC (PMID:26500094). The RICTOR locus is amplified in melanoma (PMID: 26356562) and lung cancer (PMID: 26370156).	false

Activating mutations in RIT1 are frequent in Noonan syndrome and are found in a variety of cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and myeloid malignancies.	RIT1 encodes a RAS-related small GTP-binding protein that belongs to the RAS subfamily of small GTPases (PMID: 8824319, 10545207). These proteins function as binary molecular switches; in response to external stimuli, they exchange GDP with GTP, thereby triggering several intracellular signaling networks. RIT1 is widely expressed in adult and embryonic tissue, including primary neurons and the developing brain. It plays a central role in the induction of neuronal differentiation through activation of both the BRAF/ERK and the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways (PMID: 15632082, 11914372). Additionally, RIT1 plays a role in regulating axonal versus dendritic growth, and it contributes to IFNÎ³-induced dendritic retraction (PMID: 17460085, 12668729, 18957053). RIT1 has been identified as a regulator of a p38/MAPK-dependent cascade that functions as a prosurvival mechanism in response to oxidative stress (PMID: 21737674, 21444726, 23123784). RIT1 gain-of-function mutations are associated with Noonan syndrome (PMID: 25049390, 24939608, 23791108); activating mutations in the Switch II domain of RIT1 have been observed in lung adenocarcinoma and myeloid malignancies (PMID: 25079552, 24469055, 23765226). The transforming potential of RIT1 is associated with the activation of a p38Î³-dependent signaling pathway (PMID: 11821041, 15831491).	false

RNAseH2A encodes the catalytic A subunit of the trimeric endoribonuclease RNAse H2 and functions in DNA replication through the degradation of RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids (PMID: 19015152). RNAseH2A interfaces with the non-catalytic C subunit, RNAseH2C, through interaction on its C-terminus, and this interaction is required for the catalytic activity of the RNAse H2 complex (PMID: 21454563). Alterations of RNAseH2A that appear on this interface disrupt interaction and enzymatic activity and have been implicated in the human auto-inflammatory disease Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome (PMID: 21177854). Overexpression of RNAseH2A is associated with poor patient prognosis and has been frequently identified in various cancers (PMID: 27176716, 32509219, 29843367).

RNAseH2B encodes the non-catalytic B subunit of the trimeric endoribonuclease RNAse H2 and functions in DNA replication through the degradation of RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids (PMID: 19015152). The conserved PCNA interacting protein-box sequence located on the C-terminus of RNAseH2B allows for PCNA binding to RNAseH2B to promote hydrolyzation of ribonucleotides misincorporated during replication (PMID: 19015152). Loss of RNAseH2B is associated with poor patient prognosis and has been frequently identified in various cancers including cervical cancer, intestinal carcinoma and prostate cancer (PMID: 29642758, 30273559, 35179959). RNAseH2B loss causes impairment in nucleotide excision repair and PARP trapping, leading to significant accumulation of DNA damage, genomic instability and tumorigenesis (PMID: 35179959).

Germline mutations in ROBO1 are also found in families with a predisposition for both breast and colon cancer risk.	ROBO1 is an axon guidance receptor that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins (PMID: 9458045, 27578174). ROBO1 is expressed on axon growth cones and controls midline axon crossing between the left and right half of the central nervous system (PMID: 16254601). Slit, an extracellular matrix protein, functions as a chemorepulsive signal at the midline and is a ligand for ROBO1 (PMID: 10102267). ROBO1 signaling also mediates a variety of other cellular functions including angiogenesis, migration, cell polarity, cell proliferation and mammary gland development (PMID: 27578174). SLIT2 and ROBO1 are implicated in a signaling pathway that regulates endothelial cell polarity and migration involving the effector proteins VEGFR, CDC42, NCK, and PAK2 (PMID: 26659946). Heterozygous loss of ROBO1 expression in murine models results in tumor formation, suggesting a role of ROBO1-SLIT2 signaling in cancer (PMID: 15374951). Germline ROBO1 variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including craniofacial microsomia and dyslexia, among others (PMID: 16254601, 28402530, 28286008). In addition, germline ROBO1 mutations are found in families with a predisposition for familial breast and colon cancer (PMID: 29698419, 26427657). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in ROBO1 have been identified in patients with hematopoietic malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma (PMID: 26608094, 24429703). Deletions and hypermethylation of ROBO1 are also found in a range of cancer types including lung cancer, colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinomas, among others (PMID: 12615722, 21603610, 19104841, 24500968, 27009864), suggesting that ROBO1 predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor.

ROS1 rearrangements where the kinase domain is retained (PMID: 22327623) are implicated in a range of human epithelial cancers including cholangiocarcinoma (PMID: 21253578), ovarian carcinoma (PMID: 22163003), gastric carcinoma (PMID: 23400546), angiosarcoma (PMID: 23637631) and most commonly non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 22215748). Although ROS1 rearrangements were first discovered in a human glioblastoma cell line (PMID: 2827175), there is a paucity of ROS1 rearrangements in human gliomas (PMID: 24999209). The mechanism by which ROS1 rearrangements leads to dysregulated kinase activity is not clear, as its ligand has not yet been deciphered; however, it is hypothesized to occur through constitutive kinase activation (PMID: 18083107).	false	
ENST00000370321	NM_000969	ENST00000370321	NM_000969	6125	RPL5	false			RPL5, a ribosomal protein, is infrequently altered in cancer.	RPL5 encodes for the 60S ribosomal protein L5, a component of the ribosome (PMID: 7937132, 7772601). RPL5 interacts with MDM2 to mediate protein ubiquitination and degradation in response to ribosomal stress (PMID: 16803902). RPL5 also functions as a component of the 5S RNA-protein complex through binding to 5S rRNA (PMID: 11410658). Knockdown of RPL5 in various cancer cell lines and models induces increased cellular proliferation, tumor growth and increased inflammation suggesting that RPL5 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 28147343, 33348919). Downregulation of RPL5 has been identified in various types of cancer, including glioblastoma, breast cancer and multiple myeloma (PMID: 28147343, 27909306). RPL5 mRNA expression has been suggested as a predictive biomarker for initial response to bortezomib for newly diagnosed and relapsed patients with multiple myeloma (PMID: 27909306).	true

RPS6KA4 regulates several oncogenes and is a potential chemotherapeutic target.	The ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90 kDa, polypeptide 4 (RPS6KA4, also known as MSK2 or RSK-B), is a serine/threonine protein kinase, composed of two kinase domains, the N and C-terminal kinase domains and acts as an important downstream effector of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PMID:9003374,7498520). Many growth factors, peptide hormones, and neurotransmitters regulate RPS6KA4 through Erk1/2 signaling (PMID: 10411321,10610536). Knockdown of RPS6KA4 gene expression leads to upregulation of p53 transcriptional activity and its overexpression results in the inhibition of p53 target promoters and p53-mediated apoptosis, indicating that RPS6KA4 has a p53-inhibiting function (PMID:16929179, 19797274). Moreover, the antitumoral effect of Î±-Lipoic acid (Î±-LA) on colorectal cancer cells stems, at least partially, from its property to prevent RPS6KA4-mediated p53 inhibition (PMID:23599020). MAPKs play a major role in UV-induced skin cancer development and a phospho-MAPK array analysis indicated that p38Î± and its downstream target proteins, MSK2 and HSP27, were strongly activated by UVB and SUV (PMID:23382047). RPS6KA4 is also known as MSK2 (human mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 2) and shares 64% homology with MSK1. Activated MSK1/2 is known to induce cellular transformation in various cell lines; for instance, following induction by EGF and TPA, MSK1/2 activation leads to cellular transformation of mouse epidermal cells (JB6 cells) (PMID:18381464). The role of MSK1/2 in cellular transformation also involves its ability to activate various transcription factors such as CREB, ATF1, ER81, and the p65 subunit of NFÎºB, which in turn activate the transcription of genes involved in tumorigenic and metastatic progression (PMID:22983151). MSK1/2 also mediate chromatin remodeling that is required at the enhancer and upstream promoter element for TPA-induced initiation of TFF1 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer epithelial cells (PMID:23675462). Finally, an exciting new study reported that MSK1/2 is involved in an in vivo model of skin tumor development (PMID: 21314333). Mice lacking MSK1 and 2 exhibit reduced skin tumor formation by tumor promoting agents 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and TPA in a multistage skin carcinogenesis model compared to wild-type mice. As such, MSK1/2 as a key regulator of expression of several oncogenes presents a potential target in chemotherapeutic development (PMID:21314333). Inhibition of MSK1/2 can be achieved by cell permeable molecules that have varying degrees of potency and selectivity. The two most common inhibitors used to study the effects of MSK in vitro are H89 and Ro 318220 (PMID:10998351,22983151).	false

Copy number alterations and mutations of RPS6KB2 are found in various cancers and are associated with poor prognosis.	RPS6KB2 encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase Î²-2 (S6K2), a serine/threonine kinase involved in the control of cap-independent translation of a subset of proteins, in proliferation and in cell survival (PMID: 10490847, 22431522, 17786541, 16810323). In addition, S6K2 plays a role in learning, memory and synaptic plasticity (PMID: 18174371). S6K2 is activated upon stimulation of cells with insulin, serum or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate by effectors of the PI3K signaling pathway, such as Rac, CDC42, PDK1 and PKC-Î¶ (PMID: 9804755, 10490846, 11108711, 8653792, 9445476, 10082559, 12529391). Genetic variations in RPS6KB2 are associated with Alzheimer disease (PMID: 21811019). S6K2 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels found in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and central nervous system; levels in normal tissues are relatively low, compared with levels in corresponding tumor samples (PMID: 21444676, 16810323). High levels of S6K2 are found in adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and gastric cancer (PMID: 15627062, 21748818, 15995633, 15627061, 20953835, 16810323, 23393338). Expression and localization of RPS6KB2 are distinguishing features of cancer cells (PMID: 15627062). Amplification of RPS6KB2 has prognostic value and can help predict treatment success in breast cancer. In endometrial and gastric cancers, the level of nuclear expression of RPS6KB2 correlates with tumor grade and decreased overall survival. In lung cancer, increased expression of S6K2 is correlated with drug resistance (PMID: 15627062, 21748818, 15995633, 15627061, 20953835, 16810323). Somatic mutations are found in lung adenocarcinomas in nonsmokers and are associated with worse survival (PMID: 24894543). Polymorphisms in RPS6KB2 are associated with a risk of developing colon cancer and rectal cancer (PMID: 21035469).	false

RPTOR (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) encodes a scaffolding protein that regulates the assembly, localization and substrate binding of mTORC1. mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is an atypical serine-threonine protein kinase that belongs to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family (PMID: 19339977). It interacts with several proteins to form two distinct complexes named mTOR complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2). RPTOR/raptor is a unique member of the mTRORC1 complex and serves as a scaffolding protein and is essential for mTORC1 complex activity (PMID: 25450580, 14684181, 26159692). mTORC1 is a key regulator of protein synthesis (PMID: 19339977). RPTOR binds to the translational regulator 4E-BP1 and mTORC1 then directly phosphorylates 4E-BP1, which, in turn, promotes protein synthesis (PMID: 19339977, 15718470). mTORC1 also controls the synthesis of lipids required for proliferating cells to generate membranes (PMID: 19948145). The mTOR pathway is of great importance in cancer pathogenesis (PMID: 25450580). Many components of the pathway upstream of mTORC1 are mutated in human cancers (PMID: 22500797). Derivatives of rapamycin (rapalogs) that potently inhibit mTOR activity are tested in different cancer types some of which are clinically approved (PMID: 21490404).	false

The RRAGC gene encodes a guanine-binding protein of the RAG family of GTPases; it acts as a heterodimer with RRAGCA or RRAGCB (PMID: 24095279). RRAGC targets mTORC1, a complex that responds to growth factors and various other stimuli to positively regulate cell growth that is frequently deregulated in cancer. Specifically, RRAGC regulates the intracellular localization of mTORC1 and facilitates its RHEB-dependent activation (PMID: 20381137, 27234373).

RRAS regulates diverse cellular processes including angiogenesis, vascular homeostasis, vascular regeneration, cell adhesion and neuronal axon guidance (PMID: 28610953). In addition, RRAS regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and promotes the formation of ruffling lamellipodia via its activation of phospholipase CÎµ (PMID: 16537651). RRAS mediates cell adhesion, cell spreading, cell polarization and phagocytosis via Integrin Î²1 activity (PMID: 8620538,18270267, 11257001). Loss of RRAS expression in mice results in vasculature defects, highlighting the importance of RRAS in the hematopoietic system (PMID: 27029009).

RRAS2 (also TC21) is a small GTPase protein belonging to the RRAS subfamily of Ras-like GTPases. RRAS2 primarily localizes to the plasma membrane and activates the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and JNK signaling cascades (PMID: 10557073,11850823). Interaction of RRAS2 with c-Raf initiates these downstream signaling pathways and mediates transformation and differentiation of diverse cell types (PMID: 10557073,11850823). Functional experiments have demonstrated that RRAS2 can function as an oncogene, as engineered gain-of-function mutations have high levels of transforming activity and induce transcriptional activation from Ras-responsive promoter elements (PMID: 8196649). Oncogenic mutations in RRAS2 are occasionally found in tumor cell lines (PMID: 8052619, 7478545) and RRAS2 amplification is found in many cell lines derived from breast cancer (PMID: 8552388); however, RRAS2 alterations are relatively rare in human cancers.	false

RTEL1 (Regulator of telomere length1) encodes a DNA helicase implicated in telomere length regulation, DNA repair, and maintaining genomic stability. The helicase activity of RTEL1 is essential in disassembling telomere loops and suppressing telomere fragility to maintain the integrity of chromosome ends (PMID: 24115439). In addition, it interacts with proteins in the shelterin complex known to protect telomeres during DNA replication (PMID:23959892). It also acts as an anti-recombinase to affect the disassembly of toxic DNA recombination intermediates, and thus regulates meiotic recombination and crossover homeostasis (PMID: 18957201).

RUNX1, also known as AML1 or CBFA2, is a transcription factor that is a master regulator of hematopoietic differentiation. It interacts with a diverse subset of transcriptional complexes and can act as a transcriptional activator via recruitment of histone acetyltransferases or methyltransferases (PMID: 18695000, 22012064), or a repressor via recruitment of histone deacetylases or Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (PMID: 21059642, 22325351). Due to its important role in hematopoiesis, conditional deletion of RUNX1 in mice results in an expansion of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor population, and defective T- and B-lymphocyte development (PMID: 14966519). RUNX1 is highly regulated via alternative splicing, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation, which has important regulatory consequences in cancer (PMID: 19386523). RUNX1 is frequently translocated and altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and Familial platelet disorder with predisposition for acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML) (PMID: 17290219, 15156185, 21174539). Many translocations involving RUNX1 lack the activation domain, and have a leukemogenic effect by acting as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type RUNX1 in transcription activation (PMID: 15156182).	true

RUNX1T1 (also ETO, MTG8, CBFA2T1) is a transcription factor that is a member of ETO/MTG family of proteins (PMID: 15649458). RUNX1T1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and interacts with several complexes involved in silencing of gene expression, including the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), silencing-mediator for retinoid/thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), mSin3a, and histone deacetylases (PMID: 9724795, 9819404, 9819405, 9724795). In addition, RUNX1T1 co-binds CEBPA, a transcription factor associated with tissue-specific differentiation programs (PMID: 19811452). RUNX1T1 is expressed in normal heart and brain tissues and is not highly expressed in hematopoietic lineages (PMID: 9661669, 9209371). Functional studies of RUNX1T1 activity have been predominantly completed in the context of leukemic fusion proteins; therefore, further work is necessary to study the cellular functions of wildtype RUNX1T1. The RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or t(8;21) fusion (most commonly termed AML-ETO fusion) is the most frequent translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 8338940). In this fusion protein, the RUNT homology domain of the RUNX1 gene on chromosome 21 is fused to the entirety of the RUNX1T1 gene on chromosome 8 (PMID: 11607817). The AML-ETO fusion protein is insufficient to drive leukemia in murine models and human leukemias, suggesting that a second mutational hit is required for leukemogenesis (PMID: 22875638, 26666262). This translocation functions as an oncogene by enhancing self-renewal in hematopoietic stem cells and mediating transcriptional activity via the recruitment of epigenetic complexes to target genes (PMID: 28299657, 11607817).	false

RXRA encodes the Retinoid X Receptor Alpha, which is a member of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily of transcriptional regulators. RXRA functions either as a homodimer or as a heterodimeric partner for a number of nuclear receptors. RXRA/PPARA (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor- alpha) heterodimers regulate PPARA-mediated transcriptional activity on genes involved with fatty acid oxidation, such as the cytochrome P450 system genes (PMID: 10195690). RXRA also heterodimerizes with the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R), Vitamin D3 receptor (VD3R) and Retinoic Acid Receptors (RARs). RXRA is required for forming stable complexes of these receptors with their cognate DNA response elements and for transactivation of genes regulating growth, differentiation, metabolism, homeostasis and neoplasia (PMID: 1314167, 1310351). In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) driven by PML/RARA fusion protein, RXRA is deemed essential for APL pathogenesis in vivo, even though PML/RARA can complex with DNA and transform primary hematopoietic progenitors ex vivo (PMID: 17613434).

The RYBP (RING1 and YY1 binding protein) protein is a Polycomb group protein that is involved in transcriptional regulation. RYBP is part of the Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and interacts directly with RING1, RNF2, and YY1, to mediate H2A ubiquitylation at specific polycomb target sites to repress these genes (PMID: 22325148). It has been show to play an important role in development and stem cell programming through its role in transcriptional repression (PMID: 10369680). RYBP also has polycomb-independent roles, and can act as a tumor suppressor through interaction with MDM2 and subsequent stabilization of TP53 (PMID: 19098711). The genetic locus of RYBP is frequently deleted in prostate cancers and loss of RYBP expression has been detected in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer and is associated with poor outcome (PMID: 20579941, 25344099, 26404750).	true

SAMHD1 (also AGS5 and Mg11) is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase involved in cellular dNTP homeostasis (PMID: 28502830). SAMHD1 converts dNTPs, the nitrogenous bases that are required for DNA synthesis, into deoxynucleosides after stimulation by dGTP, leading to depletion of the dNTP pool (PMID: 28502830, 22056990). The activity of SAMHD1 is regulated by the concentration of dNTPs, which allosterically bind SAMHD1 to regulate tetramerization and catalytic activity (PMID: 28502830, 25760601). In addition, SAMHD1 may also have ribonuclease activity; however, this finding is controversial (PMID: 25038827, 26101257). SAMHD1 has been implicated in additional cellular functions including innate immunity and DNA end resection during DNA repair (PMID: 19525956, 28834754). SAMHD1 is also a restriction factor that renders myeloid and dendritic cells refractory to HIV infection by hydrolyzing intracellular dNTPs in non-cycling cells, decreasing the dNTP pool required for DNA synthesis (PMID: 21613998, 22926205). Germline mutations in SAMHD1 are found in patients with Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that aberrantly activates the immune system and resembles congenital infection (PMID: 19525956). Somatic SAMHD1 mutations are found in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (PMID: 24335234). SAMHD1 is predicted to function as a tumor suppressor as mutations in SAMHD1 result in reduced protein expression (PMID: 24335234). Expression of SAMHD1 can also result in resistance to nucleoside-based chemotherapies by hydrolyzing the active triphosphate metabolites, namely in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 28502830, 27991919).	true

SCG5 (also Secretogranin V or 7B2) is a secreted chaperone protein that is a member of the granin family (PMID: 2053134, 21862681, 22947085). SCG5 is predominantly expressed in neuroendocrine tissues and functions to reduce the aggregation of other secreted proteins (PMID: 21862681, 22947085). In addition, SCG5 activates the proprotein convertase (PC2) enzyme which initiates neuroendocrine peptide maturation by facilitating transport of protein precursors through the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory pathway (PMID: 11719503, 11439082, 10799554, 9881669). Additional studies have identified SCG5 as a Î²-cell associated antigen that is recognized by naÃ¯ve CD8-positive T-cells (PMID: 30078552). Aberrant SCG5 activity has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and mediates amyloid-Î² and Î±-synuclein aggregation (PMID: 23172224).

SERPIN proteins predominantly function by disrupting the active sites of proteases and forming irreversibly covalent SERPIN-protease complexes (PMID: 27637160). Specifically, SERPINB3 mainly targets papain-like cysteine proteases such as Cathepsin L, S, and K and papain (PMID: 27637160). SERPINB3, and the tandemly duplicated paralog SERPINB4, have a domain that shares sequence homology with ovalbumin, a classic model antigen (PMID: 26375851). Increased expression of SERPINB3 is found in respiratory inflammatory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tuberculosis, implicating SERPINB3 in stress responses and autoimmunity (PMID: 19332150, 23325331, 25111616). In addition, SERPINB3 has been associated with the regulation of apoptosis due to altered surface antigen presentation (PMID: 19332150). SERPINB3 expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types; however, functional experiments have identified both growth-promoting and inhibitory roles of SERPINB3 (PMID: 29491058, 27637160, 25544768). Somatic mutations in SERPINB3 are found in patients with cutaneous melanoma, and these alterations are associated with improved survival following immune checkpoint blockade therapies (PMID: 26091043, 27668655).

"SET, also known as template activating factor-IÎ² (TAF-IÎ²), is a multi-functioning protein that acts as a template activating factor, histone chaperone and phosphatase 2A inhibitor (PMID: 34021475). SET is involved in DNA replication through processes such as transcription, nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling (PMID: 34021475). 
As a subunit of the inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) complex, SET inhibits the activity of histone acetyltransferase and exerts chaperone activity by binding to core histones, specifically histone 3 and histone 4 (PMID: 34021475,17360516). Inhibiting the acetylation of nucleosomes is an important event in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 11163245). The SET complex, composed of SET and granzyme A-activated endonuclease NH23-H1, also regulates apoptosis following the attack of cytolytic T cells and NK cells (PMID: 1618237). In response to superoxide generated by granzyme A, the SET complex translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus and regulates apoptosis through the inhibition of phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major mammalian protein serine-threonine phosphatase, which is a tumor suppressor that inhibits cell proliferation via the dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 (PMID: 34021475, 862667). Impaired regulation of PP2A by SET loss may lead to acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 8626647), and translocations involving the SET gene are found in various forms of acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 34021475, 8626647)."	false

SETBP1 is a DNA binding protein that functions as an epigenetic remodeler (PMID: 28881700). Binding of SETBP1 to proteins with SET domains, typically present in histone methyltransferases, allows for the methylation of substrates, including histone tails (PMID: 25306901). SETBP1 activates gene expression in part by mediating the recruitment of the HCF1/KMT2A/PHF8 epigenetic complex to regions of chromatin (PMID: 29875417). In addition, SETBP1 binds the protein SET, an inhibitor of the phosphatase PP2A, and overexpression of SETBP1 results in reduced PP2A expression and leukemic proliferation (PMID: 19965692). In preclinical studies, SETBP1 has been shown to mediate self-renewal in leukemia cells and to regulate the expression of the HOXA gene cluster (PMID: 22566606, 25306901). Expression of SETBP1 is also associated with organ development and neuronal activation (PMID: 29875417). Germline mutations in SETBP1 have been identified in patients with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, a congenital disorder that presents with neurological symptoms and increased risk of malignancy (PMID: 28346496, 20436468). Somatic SETBP1 mutations are found in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (PMID: 23832012, 23222956). Alterations in SETBP1 occur in a hotspot region that is within a degron motif that facilitates substrate recognition by the SCF-Î²-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase. These mutations disrupt SETBP1 degradation by the E3 ligase complex, suggesting that SETBP1 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 29875417, 28346496).	false

SETD1A modifies histone tails by trimethylating histone H3 at lysine 4, resulting in an epigenetic signal that is associated with actively transcribed genes or genes poised for transcription (PMID: 18838538, 24126056). Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). The formation of an epigenetic complex including CFP1, RBBP5, ASH2, WDR5, and WDR82 is required for effective SETD1A enzymatic modification of histone tails (PMID: 17998332). SETD1A shares substantial homology with SETD1B, however, these two methyltransferases have non-redundant functions in the regulation of gene expression (PMID: 17355966). In addition, the SETD1A complex binds to RNA polymerase II and influences the initiation of transcription (PMID: 17998332 ). SETD1A also interacts with several additional chromatin-modifying enzymes that influence gene expression and chromatin state (PMID: 18765639, 20622854, 23353889). The activity of SETD1A is required for many stages of development including embryonic and neural stem cell survival, maternal oocyte gene expression and hematopoietic lineage specification (PMID: 24550110, 28619824, 27141965, 23754954, 25550471). In addition, SETD1A has been implicated in the maintenance of stalled replication fork and the regulation of DNA repair pathways with implications for genome stability (PMID: 29937342, 29348130). Loss-of-function mutations in SETD1A are found in patients with schizophrenia and developmental disorders (PMID: 26974950, 24853937).

The activity of SETD1B is also required for many stages of development including embryonic and neural stem cell survival and maternal oocyte gene expression (PMID: 24550110, 28619824). Microdeletions and mutations in SETD1B have been associated with disorders that result in intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities (PMID: 27106595, 29322246). Somatic fusion proteins and mutations have been identified in several tumor types including hematopoietic malignancies, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and endometrial cancers, among others (PMID: 24925220, 24670651, 24382738, 27997699, 29967129).

SETD2 encodes a chromatin modulating enzyme that functions by site specific trimethylation of histone H3K36. It was originally identified as a contributing enzyme in the pathogenesis of Huntington Disease and thus was initially named Huntington Interacting Protein B (HYPB) (PMID: 9700202). Histone methylation is a highly controlled biological process that regulates gene expression by altering the ability of RNA polymerase II to interact with DNA and thus initiate transcription (PMID:16118227, 25123655). Additionally, the SETD2-regulated H3K36 histone mark has been shown to play a role in regulating DNA mismatch repair. This suggests that inactivation of this protein can lead to enhanced genetic instability, enrichment of nonsense and frameshift mutations and ultimately oncogenic transformation of cells (PMID: 23622243, 25123655, 25728682, 24931610). Importantly, SETD2-mutant renal tumors failed to activate the p53 tumor suppressor, thus providing an alternative pathway for the inactivation of p53 that leads to defects in DNA damage repair (PMID: 24843002).	true

SETD4 has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancer cells that are estrogen receptor negative (PMID: 24738023). Knockdown of SETD4 expression in breast cancer cells results in reduced proliferation and cell cycle progression (PMID: 24738023).

SETD6 can also methylate non-histone proteins including PAK4 and RELA (PMID: 26841865, 21131967), leading to altered WNT and NF-KB signaling, respectively. SETD6 monomethylates RELA, a component of the NF-KB signaling pathway, resulting in a methylated protein that binds chromatin at RELA target genes (PMID: 21131967). The methylated RELA protein reduces chromatin accessibility at NF-KB target genes, leading to a restrained NF-KB inflammatory response (PMID: 21131967, 21515635).

SETDB1 (also ESET, KMT1E) is a histone methyltransferase that is a member of the SET domain family of chromatin remodeling enzymes. SETDB1 modifies histone tails by methylating histone H3 at lysine 9, resulting in an epigenetic signal that is associated with repressed gene expression and genes poised for activation (PMID: 11959841). Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). SETDB1-dependent H3K9me3 methylation results in the recruitment of HP1-alpha, leading chromatin remodeling to a more heterochromatic state (PMID: 11959841). In addition, SETDB1 binds protein complexes implicated in transcriptional repression including KRAB-KAP1 and MDB1-CAF1 (PMID: 11959841, 15327775). SETDB1 also interacts with several proteins involved in sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and homologous recombination (PMID: 18501190, 26206670) and mediates gene repression in embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells (PMID: 19884255, 21624812, 27301860). SETDB1 can also regulate the activity of other epigenetic complexes involved in the repression of gene expression, including Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (PMID: 26160163). SETDB1 can methylate non-histone substrates including p53, which leads to recognition and degradation of P53 by MDM2 (PMID: 26471002). SETDB1 has been identified within a melanoma susceptibility locus and SETDB1 expression promotes melanoma formation (PMID: 26471002, 21430779). In addition, SETDB1 is recurrently amplified in melanoma and lung cancer (PMID: 21430779, 23770855). Somatic mutations, fusion events, and splice alterations are found in mesothelioma, leading to protein inactivation, suggesting that SETDB1 can function as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene in distinct cellular contexts (PMID: 26928227, 26824986).	true

SETDB2 modifies histone tails by methylating histone H3 at lysine 9, resulting in an epigenetic signal that is associated with repressed gene expression and genes poised for activation (PMID: 20404330). Histone proteins, essential components of the nucleosome, consist of DNA wrapped around eight histone protein molecules (two sets of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones), and histone tail modifications provide signals for the activation or repression of gene expression (PMID: 11498575). SETDB2 functions to recruit HP1-alpha to centromeres and maintains heterochromatin states in repetitive elements and centromere-associated repeats, implicating SETDB2 in chromosome condensation (PMID: 20404330). SETDB2 is also important in the regulation of acute immune responses, is activated during viral infection, and may mediate bacterial infection susceptibility (PMID: 27572307, 25419628).

SF3B1 (splicing factor 3b subunit 1) is a component of the spliceosome complex that regulates the removal of introns from messenger RNA (PMID: 28958291). SF3B1 binds to nucleosomes to identify exon and intron junctions of coding genes (PMID: 25892229). Importantly, SF3B1 preferentially regulates alternative splicing and 3â splice site selection (PMID: 28445500). In addition, SF3B1 plays a role in the maintenance of genomic integrity due to contributions to sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation (PMID: 25257310). Somatic mutations in SF3B1 are recurrent in uveal melanoma (PMID: 26842708) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (PMID: 21909114, 21995386), especially those with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (PMID: 21995386, 21998214). Mutations in SF3B1 lead to altered gene expression and aberrant alternative splicing (PMID: 25428262) and tend to be missense mutations rather than nonsense or frameshift mutations, suggesting either gain-of-function or dominant negative activity (PMID: 22150006, 21909114). The SF3B spliceosome complex can be inhibited by naturally occurring compounds, including spliceostatin A (PMID: 17643111), and SF3B1-mutant cells are preferentially sensitive to spliceosome inhibitors (PMID: 29457796).	false

SF3B2 encodes for subunit 2 of the splicing factor 3b protein (SF3B) complex, which functions in pre-mRNA splicing (PMID: 27720643). The SF3B complex assembles with 12S RNA to form the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (U2 snRNP) to bind pre-mRNA upstream of the intron branch site (PMID: 12234937). Haploinsufficiency of SF3B2 has been associated with sporadic and familial craniofacial microsomia (PMID: 34344887). Knockout of SF3B2 in cancer cell lines and models suppresses tumor growth and cellular migration and invasion, suggesting that SF3B2 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 35715826, 34611311). Amplification of SF3B2 has been identified in various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, bladder cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 31431456). SF3B2 is suggested to confer resistance to AR-targeting therapy in prostate cancer by promoting AR-V7 expression through RNA splicing (PMID: 31431456).	false

SFRP1 is an extracellular signaling ligand that is a member of the secreted frizzled-related protein family (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). SFRP1 functions as a negative regulator of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to WNT or Frizzled (Fz) receptors and precluding WNT-mediated activation of downstream signaling (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID: 28218291). SFRP1-mediated antagonism of WNT results in the activation of the Î²-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3Î², and AXIN) which targets Î²-catenin for degradation (PMID: 23258168). In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of Î²-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). In addition, SFRP1 activity has been linked to the regulation of stress-related senescence, proliferation and metastasis (PMID: 22927647, 11593386, 24316024). Somatic mutations in SFRP1 are not well studied in human cancers; however, epigenetic silencing of SFRP1 transcription has been implicated in several cancer types, including breast cancer (PMID: 28218291, 11992124, 16449975, 11593386).

SGK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the AGC family of protein kinases (PMID: 28236975). SGK1 (serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase) is activated by growth factors and is a signaling effector in the phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase signaling pathway (PI3K) (PMID: 8455596, 10357815). In the PI3K signaling pathway, SGK1 is phosphorylated and activated by the kinases PDK1 and mTORC2 (PMID: 10357815). SGK1 regulates the expression of a variety of downstream targets including NDRG1, GSK3Î², FOXO3, NEDD4L, and PIKFYVE, among others (PMID: 11154281, 10191262). AKT and SGK1 signaling have some overlapping upstream and downstream effectors and SGK1 can partially compensate for AKT activity (PMID: 29055016). In addition, SGK1 increases the activity of a variety of ion channels, ion carriers and the Na+/K+ ATPases; therefore, salt levels and other environmental stimuli are predicted to activate SGK1 activity (PMID: 23467085). SGK1 signaling has been implicated in a variety of other cellular functions including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, membrane protein turnover, regulation of cell volume, transcription and macrophage recruitment (PMID: 22556335, 28236975, 9114008). Somatic gain-of-function mutations in SGK1 are found in patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) and T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (PMID: 26658840, 30213827). In addition, overexpression of SGK1 is found in patients with breast cancer (PMID: 16246546).

SH2B3 (also LNK) is a plasma membrane-associated adaptor protein that negatively regulates signal transduction initiated by growth factor and cytokine receptor kinases (PMID:11805142, 18753636). SH2B3 is most highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and negatively regulates the activity of several hematopoietic kinases including c-Kit, MPL (thrombopoietin receptor), JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2), PDGFR (Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor, and EPOR (erythropoietin receptor). Deletion of SH2B3 in murine models results in abnormal hematopoiesis characterized by expansion of the hematopoietic progenitor population (PMID: 11805142). SH2B3-regulated signaling has been implicated in B-cell development, T-cell activation, and hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation (PMID:11114373, 10799879, 11805142). Germline mutations in SH2B3 are associated with autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, celiac disease and hypertension (PMID:19430479, 18311140, 19073967) as well as predisposition to leukemia (PMID:23908464).

SH2D1A (also SAP) is an adaptor protein that binds to the lymphocyte cell surface protein Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule (SLAM) (PMID: 9774102). SLAM receptors are expressed on hematopoietic cells and regulate lymphocyte activity (PMID: 18031694). SH2D1A competes with the recruitment of signaling molecules such as SHP-2 phosphatase and also functions as a scaffold to recruit Fyn kinase (PMID: 12458214). Recruitment of SH2D1A is important for the regulation and development of B-cells, NK cells, and T-cells including humoral immunity, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity (PMID: 15711562, 20153220, 15774582, 12529646). SH2D1A plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis and mediates lymphocyte proliferation via the apoptotic pathway (PMID: 19738428). Germline mutations and deletions in SH2D1A are associated with X-linked immune dysfunction, susceptibility to EBV infection, and lymphoproliferative disease (PMID: 9771704).

Mechanistically, under M-ras activation, SHOC2 facilitates PP1c-mediated dephosphorylation of the Raf-1 Ser-259 inhibitory site (PMID: 16630891). SHOC2 overexpression induces proliferation and tumorigenic growth in EGF-mediated and Ras-mutant cancer cells (PMID: 25514808, 24211266). Genetic alterations of SHOC2 are rarely seen in tumors. Germline mutations at specific SHOC2 sites are causal variants of neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous disorders such as Noonan-like syndrome and other RASopathies (PMID: 19684605, 23918763, 25137548).	false

The H/ACA box is involved in processing of rRNA, modifications of species of RNAs, and stabilization of telomeres (PMID: 20227365, 19383767). SHQ1 are shown to bind NAP57, which is an essential member of H/ACA, prior to the binding of another accessory protein, NAF1, and is thought to assist in the shuttling of the complex to nucleoli (PMID: 20227365, 19383767). SHQ1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain known as the CS domain (named after CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1) which appears to be essential for H/ACA complex formation (PMID: 19426738, 19019820).

SLC9A3R1 is expressed abundantly in the plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells and functions as a scaffold protein by stabilizing macromolecule signaling complexes linking extracellular signals with cytoskeleton machinery. Major signaling pathways that are regulated by SLC9A3R1 include the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as PDGFR, EGFR, and Wnt/êµ-catenin signaling (PMID: 33965858, 29846905, 28684865, 28068322). SLC9A3R1 regulates transporters and channels through actin-binding ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) proteins (PMID: 28068322). The role of SLC9A3R1 in cancer depends on its cellular location, acting as a tumor suppressor when localized in the cell membrane and as an oncogene when expressed in the cytoplasm or nucleus of cancer cells, where it participates in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process (PMID: 33965858, 29846905, 28684865). SLC9A3R1 expression in the nucleus has been observed in renal, breast, liver, colon, and ovarian cancer cells (PMID: 33965858, 28011475).

SLFN11 binds and negatively regulates RPA (Replication Protein Complex A), a complex that associates with single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks and recruits repair proteins to resolve the forks (PMID: 26658330). SLFN11 mediates the destabilization of the RPA-single-stranded-DNA complex and inhibits DNA repair by altering checkpoint maintenance and homologous recombination (PMID: 26658330). In addition, SLFN11 inhibits the translation of the DNA damage kinases ATR and ATM via specific cleavage of transfer RNAs (PMID: 30374083). SLFN11 couples IFN-Î³ to the DNA repair pathway and loss of SLFN11 dampens T-cell responses (PMID: 30753225). Expression of SLFN11 predicts for sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, and DNA synthesis inhibitors in cancer cell line datasets and in clinical studies (PMID: 22460905, 22927417, 29906251, 27708213). In small cell lung cancer, SLFN11 expression is repressed in models of chemoresistance due to chromatin-mediated silencing (PMID: 26658330).

SLIT2 is proteolytically processed into C-terminal fragments (SLIT2-C) and N-terminal fragments (SLIT2-N), which both function in promoting chemotaxis through regulation of chemoattractants and increasing cell migration speed (PMID: 10102266, 30510066). The oncogenic function of SLIT2 is likely tissue-specific. Knockdown of SLIT2 in various cancer cell lines and models induces cellular migration and invasion, suggesting that SLIT2 functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in these tissue-specific contexts (PMID: 30648543, 18611862, 34093772, 25490006).

The SWI/SNF complex plays a role in altering chromatin structure, a process that is necessary for various cellular functions, including gene regulation, DNA repair, differentiation, and lineage specification (PMID: 28391084, 21654818, 26601204). SMARCA2, or the ATP helicase SMARCA4, form a multicomponent complex by partnering with 15 core and adaptor proteins to mediate interactions with DNA and chromatin (PMID: 28391084, 26601204). Germline heterozygous mutations in SMARCA2 are found in patients with Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), a disorder characterized by intellectual disabilities and altered development (PMID: 22366787, 31375262). NCBRS-associated SMARCA2 mutations result in enhancer reprogramming, leading to a redistribution of SMARCA4 on chromatin (PMID: 31375262). Somatic mutations in SMARCA2 in human cancers are more uncommon than SMARCA4 alterations; however, SMARCA2 has been found to be silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in several cancer types (PMID: 29391527,  28391084, 17546055). Because SMARCA2 can replace SMARCA4 in SMARCA4-deficient tumors, SMARCA2 inhibition may be efficacious in cancer types with SMARCA4 mutations (PMID: 24421395, 24520176).

SMARCA4 is an ATP-dependent helicase that is a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (PMID: 21654818). This complex plays a role in altering chromatin structure, a process that is necessary for various cellular functions, including transcription, DNA synthesis and DNA repair (reviewed in PMID: 25387058). Secondary to ARID1A, SMARCA4 is the most frequently mutated gene among the SWI/SNF subunits and is significantly altered in malignant rhabdoid tumors, lymphoma, medulloblastoma, lung and ovarian cancer (PMID: 23644491, 25060813, 23143597).

SMARCB1 (INI1, BAF47, SNF5) is present in all known variants of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and is thus considered a core subunit (PMID: 10078207). SWI/SNF complexes are ATP dependent nucleosome remodelers which are required for efficient accessibility of genes to the transcriptional machinery (PMID: 14964309). SWI/SNF complexes are important for normal human development and are required for the transition of transcriptional programs during cellular differentiation(PMID: 23568486). In cancer, SMARCB1 acts as a strong tumor suppressor. It is mutated in rhabdoid tumours, familial schwannomatosis, small-cell hepatoblastomas, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, undifferentiated sarcomas, epitheliod sarcomas, meningiomas and poorly differentiated chordomas (PMID: 9671307, 21057957, 17357086, 18985717, 18580682, 18997735, 15899790, 20930055). Heterozygous SMARCB1 mutations are found in patients with rhabdoid predisposition syndrome, which is characterized by the inheritance of a defective SMARCB1 allele followed by the loss of the remaining allele in the tumours (PMID: 10521299). Mouse models of SMARCB1 mutations recapitulate the tumor suppressor functions observed in humans (PMID: 11095756, 12450796, 16301525). The exact mechanism by which SMARCB1 loss leads to malignant transformation is not yet well understood, however, expression analyses have shown that one consequence of SMARCB1 loss is the activation of gene expression programmes that are associated with proliferation and dedifferentiation (PMID: 21076395). Recently, it was found that SMARCB1 mutant cells depend on the PRC2 component EZH2 which has lead to clinical trials of EZH2 inhibitors in patients with SMARCB1 mutant cancers (PMID: 21654818, 20951942, 26552009, 23620515).	true

The SMARCD1 gene has been found mutated in breast cancer and the SMARCD1 protein is derepressed in gastric and prostate cancer.	The SMARCD1 gene encodes the protein SMARCD1, (SWI/SNF related, Matrix associated, Actin dependent Regulator of Chromatin, subfamily D, member 1) also known as BAF60A (BRG1-Associated Factor 60A). The SMARCD1 protein is a member of the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable) complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that alters the location or conformation of nucleosomes by using the energy of ATP hydrolysis and thus can regulate transcription of certain genes. To this end, SMARCD1 interacts with a wide repertoire of transcription factors including Oct3/4, Sox2, Sox10, c-Fos/c-Jun, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î±, vitamin D receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, retinoid-related orphan receptor Î±, androgen receptor and recruits them to the SWI/SNF complex (PMID: 11053448, 12917342, 14698202, 18680712, 19762545, 20508149, 21725993, 22334693). SMARCD1 is required for Tbx1-driven expression of Wnt5a, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that promotes cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer (PMID: 22438823, 17079465). Moreover, SMARCD1 interacts directly and indirectly with key regulators of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, which in some cases maintains pluripotency (PMID:19279220) and in other cases restricts it (PMID: 25818293). A series of recent studies showed that SMARCD1 is a direct target of tumor-suppressive miRNA (micro RNAs), namely miR-99 in prostate cancer (PMID: 21212412), miR-490-3p in gastric and ovarian cancer (PMID: 25503559, 25819031) and miR-100 in breast cancer stem-like cells (PMID: 25217527). On the other hand, tumor-suppressive properties of SMARCD1 have been reported; interaction between SMARCD1 and p53 is required for p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (PMID: 18303029) and SMARCD1 is frequently inactivated by truncating mutations in breast cancer (PMID: 22722201). It becomes therefore obvious that the function of SMARCD1 in carcinogenesis is complex and context-dependent.	false

The SMARCE1 subunit has the ability to bind cruciform structures in DNA which might lead to SWI/SNF targeting to sites with distinct chromatin architecture (PMID: 26601204, 27149204). In addition, SMARCE1 is predicted to have a role in mediating chromatin relaxation and disassembly of the SWI/SNF complex (PMID: 27149204). SMARCE1 also has roles in lymphocyte development and in both androgen and estrogen-mediated transcription (PMID: 12110891, 16769725, 18559499, 23493350).

SMG1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family (PIKK) (PMID: 11544179). SMG1 is an essential protein that regulates nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a process that removes incorrect mRNAs that contain premature translation termination codons, and hence encode for aberrant proteins (PMID: 11544179). SMG1 phosphorylates UPF1, an ATPase and RNA helicase involved in NMD, and binds additional proteins involved in mRNA surveillance (PMID: 11544179, 12554878, 18160036). UPF1 and SMG1 form a complex with translation release factors and function as a translation termination complex (PMID: 19417104). SMG1 activity is required for various cellular functions including cell cycle progression, mRNA export, translation, DNA repair, genome stability, apoptosis, and telomere maintenance (PMID: 16199763, 16488880, 16861888, 18326048, 18332866). In addition, NMD or disruption of SMG1 mRNA surveillance activity can lead to alternative splicing to circumvent premature translation termination codons (PMID: 17693403, 20566848). Loss or overexpression of SMG1 results in accumulation or degradation of mRNAs with premature termination codons as demonstrated in functional experiments (PMID: 11544179). NMD can exacerbate developmental disorders that result in mRNAs with premature translation termination codons, such as Ullrichâs disease, and inhibition of SMG1 can restore some normal cellular function (PMID: 16807116). SMG1 is infrequently mutated in human cancers, however, heterozygous loss of SMG1 in murine models results in tumor formation (PMID: 23277562) suggesting that SMG1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Expression of SMG1 is found in several tumor types including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (PMID: 22247495, 25257528).

Smoothened (SMO) is a conserved signal transducer of the hedgehog signaling pathway, playing important roles in normal embryonic and neuronal development as well as tumorigenesis (PMID: 23719536, 21614026, 26912893). SMO is a seven-transmembrane domain protein bearing some structural and functional similarity to G-protein coupled receptors (PMID: 23636324). SMO activity is normally inhibited by patched (PTCH1), an upstream component of the Hedgehog pathway, via poorly understood mechanisms (PMID: 23719536). Binding of extracellular Hedgehog ligands to PTCH1 leads to consecutive activation of SMO, which in turn induces modifications of the downstream GLI transcription factors leading to their activation. Activating mutations in SMO lead to constitutive activation of GLI-mediated transcription of important oncogenic genes. Such mutations have been implicated in sporadic basal cell carcinoma (PMID: 9422511, 26950094) and medulloblastoma (PMID: 21614026) and have been identified in many other tumor types. Recent efforts have been made to specifically target SMO (PMID: 26781311, 26931153, 26919418, 26843616, 26527777).

ENST00000330871	NM_003955.4	ENST00000330871	NM_003955.4	9021	SOCS3	false			SOCS3, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, is infrequently mutated in various cancer types.	SOCS3 is an adaptor protein that suppresses cytokine signaling and functions in negative feedback inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PMID: 17525754). SOCS3 binds phosphotyrosines on receptor and non-receptor kinases to mediate inhibition of cytokine signaling (PMID:10064597, 24600449). Namely, SOCS3 negatively regulates the activity of the JAK non-receptor tyrosine kinase family, leading to reduced translocation of activated STAT3 transcription factor complexes to the nucleus (PMID: 22342841, 24600449, 22566904). In addition, SOCS3 can target proteins for degradation via interactions with E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (PMID: 29712772, 25939384). Regulation of cytokine signaling by SOCS3 is an important mediator of various cellular functions including immune homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and survival (PMID: 24069550, 24600449, 22566904). Somatic mutations in SOCS3 are relatively rare in human cancer; however, epigenetic silencing of SOCS3 transcription has been identified in several hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors including mantle cell lymphomas, myeloproliferative neoplasms and prostate cancer, among others (PMID: 23432547, 26216197, 18440067, 20717995). Deletion of SOCS3 in myeloid suppressor populations in the tumor microenvironment also promotes tumor progression in solid tumors, due to dampening of anti-tumor immune responses (PMID: 26967393, 25649351, 29626115).	true

SOS1 is a guanine exchange factor (GEF) that positively regulates the activation of the RAS proteins in the MAP-kinase (MAPK) pathway. SOS1 is recruited to the plasma membrane, binds the adaptor molecule GRB2 and facilitates the activated, GTP-bound state of RAS, which in turn initiates the MAPK pathway signaling cascade (PMID: 8493579). The activity of SOS1 is required to mediate cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, oxidative stress, cell migration, and invasion (PMID: 27157612). SOS1 also activates the G protein RAC by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP (PMID: 9438849, 22042618). Germline mutations in SOS1 have been identified in certain forms of Noonan syndrome, a hereditary disorder of congenital heart disease (PMID: 17143285, 17143282). However, somatic alterations in SOS1 are rare events in human cancers (PMID: 18064648; cBioPortal, MSKCC, Jan. 2018).	false

Methylation and downregulation of SOX17 are found in colon, liver, lung and breast cancers.	SOX17 encodes a member of the SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) family of transcription factors and acts as an important antagonist of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of Î²-catenin/TCF via a GSK3Î²-independent mechanism. The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in many biological processes including embryonic development to stem cell maintenance. For example, conditional ablation of SOX17 in mouse uterine tissue resulted in inhibition of endometrial adenogenesis and a loss of reproductive capacity (PMID:27102016). Interestingly, conditional deletion of SOX17 from mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) led to the loss of fetal and neonatal but not adult HSCs, proving its importance in the maintenance of fetal and neonatal HSCs but not adult HSCs (PMID:17655922).	true

Amplifications of SOX2 are found in glioblastomas, small cell lung cancers and squamous cell carcinomas.	SOX2 encodes a transcriptional factor essential to embryonic stem cell development and the determination of cell fate. It functions as an activator or suppressor of gene transcription through a highly specific DNA binding (high-mobility group) domain (PMID: 20016762). Together with Oct-4 and Nanog, Sox2 positive regulates transcription of pluripotency factors involved in the Leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathway (PMID:19571885). SOX2 has recently been implicated in cancer development, by promoting oncogenic signaling and maintaining cancer stem cells. It has been shown to promote cellular proliferation in breast (PMID: 22561374), prostate (PMID: 24659665), pancreatic (PMID: 23917223) and cervical cancers (PMID: 21415100); and to evade apoptotic signaling in prostate (PMID: 24325912), gastric cancer (PMID: 21415100) and non small cell lung cancer (PMID: 24233838). SOX2 has also been associated with an increased in the metastatic potential of these cancers (PMID: 22069467, 22184093, 22912670, 23895273). SOX2 amplification is observed in several cancer types including glioblastoma, small-cell lung cancer and many forms of squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 20126410, 21518820, 22069467, 20372069, 19801978, 21334718, 22941189, 19787784). Its heterozygous mutations have been associated with developmental disorders, such as aanophthalmia-esophagel-genital (AEG) syndrome (PMID: 16543359) and syndromic microphthalmia, a structural eye malformation (PMID: 23463581).	false	
ENST00000245479	NM_000346.3	ENST00000245479	NM_000346.3	6662	SOX9	true			SOX9 encodes a putative tumor suppressor and transcription factor involved in organ and skeletal development. This gene is frequently mutated in colorectal cancer.	The SOX9 (Sex-determining Region Y box 9) gene encodes a transcription factor involved in organ and skeletal development. It is expressed widely throughout the body and regulates multiple developmental processes, such as embryonal cell-fate determination, chondrogenesis and testis formation; however, SOX9 also functions in developed tissues (PMID: 25685828). SOX9 is a transcriptional target of the WNT pathway, but also functions as a regulator of WNT pathway target genes (PMID: 17698607). Additionally, SOX9 can facilitate Î²-catenin degradation by promoting its phosphorylation (PMID: 19047045). Due to its role in development, deleterious mutations of SOX9 can cause developmental disorders; mutations of SOX9 are also implicated in various other disorders (PMID: 25685828). SOX9 mutations are frequent in colorectal cancer and dysregulation of SOX9 is implicated in cancer development in multiple tissue types (PMID: 22810696, 24302456, 22246670, 15084848, 20049725).	true

SP140 is a nuclear protein that is a member of the SP100 family of proteins (PMID: 8695863). SP140 is predominantly expressed in lymphoid cells and associates with nuclear bodies, which are suborganelles that carry out specific nuclear functions (PMID: 28577509). These functions include the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA, oxidative stress response, gene expression regulation, cellular proliferation and innate immunity, among others (PMID: 21068152). SP140 shares homology with SP100, a protein known to associate with PML in nuclear bodies to mediate various cellular processes (PMID: 8910577, 10913195). In acute promyelocytic leukemia, SP140 co-localizes with PML in nuclear bodies and this association increases after treatment with retinoic acid (PMID: 8910577). SP140 can also function as an epigenetic reader protein, which is important in mediating the repression of immune response related genes (PMID: 24267382, 28783698). Loss of SP140 in macrophages results in altered expression of transcriptional programs and compromises the immune response to microbe infection (PMID: 28783698). SP140 is predicted to function as a tumor suppressor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and several variants in SP140 have been associated with increased risk for CLL (PMID: 18758461, 22235315). In addition, SP140 is hypomethylated in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia, leading to decreased gene expression (PMID: 22395470, 26568194). Somatic mutations in SP140 are also found in patients with multiple myeloma (PMID: 25743686).	true	
ENST00000375759	NM_015001.2	ENST00000375759	NM_015001.2	23013	SPEN	false			SPEN encodes a tumor suppressor that regulates transcription of ERÎ±-target genes and has been associated with tumor growth inhibition. Somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity of SPEN have been found in breast cancer.	The SPEN gene encodes the protein, SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein (SHARP), mainly involved in transcriptional repression, embryogenesis and development through regulation of the Notch, TCF/LEF, and EGFR signaling pathways. SHARP is a large 402 kDA protein composed of four N-terminal RNA-binding domains and a conserved C-terminal Spen Paralog and Ortholog C-terminal (SPOC) domain. Through these domains, SHARP directly interacts with SMRT, HDAC1, and HDAC2. SPEN also acts as an estrogen-inducible cofactor by binding the steroid receptor RNA coactivator SRA which enhances ERÎ± activity and ultimately modulates the transcription of ERÎ± target genes. (PMID: 11331609, 26297734) Recent studies studying ERÎ±-expressing breast cancer cell lines have identified mutations and LOH in SPEN that lead to underexpression that may be a predictive biomarker of tamoxifen response. ERÎ±-positive breast cell lines expressing higher levels of SPEN correlated with better outcome in patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. (PMID: 26297734).	true

SPOP mutations are predominantly found in prostate and endometrial cancers; however, the full functional consequence of these mutations remains under investigation.	SPOP (Speckle-type POZ protein) is an adaptor protein in the CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex that recognizes substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the proteasome (PMID: 19818708). The repertoire of SPOP substrates is not well characterized; however, notable proteins include SRC3, DAXX, H2AFY, AR, BMI1, DEK, ESR1 and TRIM24 (PMID: 25278611, 15897469, 25274033, 21577200, 25766326). The CUL3-SPOP complex negatively regulates the transcriptional repressor DAXX, hence impacting the expression of endothelial pathway genes that are regulated by DAXX (PMID: 28216678). Somatic mutations in SPOP are reported in approximately 5% of endometrial cancers (PMID: 23104009) and 10% of prostate cancers (PMID: 21307934, 22610119). SPOP-mediated degradation has also been implicated in the regulation of PD-L1, a key regulatory immune ligand (PMID: 29160310). SPOP mutations in both endometrial and prostate cancer cluster in conserved residues of the MATH domain important for substrate recognition, suggesting that the mutations either alter substrate recognition or act as a dominant negative to prevent substrate degradation (PMID: 21307934, 22610119). There is emerging evidence that SPOP may be a more general tumor suppressor in glioblastoma, gastric and colorectal cancers, as SPOP expression is decreased through tumor progression (PMID: 25351530, 23216165).	true

The SPRED1 gene encodes a member of the Sprouty family of proteins. SPRED1 is a negative regulator of the MAP-kinase (MAPK) pathway (PMID: 15683364, 21364986). The mechanism by which SPRED1 inhibits MAPK signaling involves NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), which, upon interaction with SPRED1, localizes to the plasma membrane and facilitates RAS inactivation (PMID: 22751498, 26635368). Overexpression of SPRED1 in a hepatocellular carcinoma model leads to a decrease in cell motility and an increase in the expression of metalloproteinases, which are involved in invasion and metastasis (PMID: 16652141). SPRED1 is rarely mutated in cancers (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Dec. 2016). However, germline loss-of-function mutations in SPRED1 are the cause of Legius syndrome, a familial disorder with neurofibromatosis-like features (PMID: 24334617, 17704776, 19366998) and SPRED1 has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in mucosal melanoma (PMID: 30385465).	true

SPRTN (also C1orf124, Spartan, or DVC1) is a metalloprotease that functions as a DNA repair adaptor protein (PMID: 25496645, 27852435). SPRTN recruits the protein segregase p97 to stalled replication forks, allowing for p97 to remove the translesional synthesis polymerase (Pol Î·) and for DNA replication to bypass lesions (PMID: 23042605). The activity of SPRTN is required to block excessive translesional DNA synthesis and reduce mutations caused by DNA damage (PMID: 23042607, 23042605). SPRTN associates with monoubiquitinated PCNA, the processivity factor that promotes translesional synthesis, to remove p97 from blocked replication forks (PMID: 23042605, 27084448). SPRTN also has the ability to resolve DNA-protein crosslinks, which contributes to the role of SPRTN in the DNA damage response (PMID: 27852435, 27871365). Loss of SPRTN expression results in increased mutagenesis after UV light stimulation, cellular senescence, hypersensitivity to replication stress-inducing agents and age-related phenotypes in mice (PMID: 23042605, 25501849, 27871366, 28199696). Germline mutations in SPRTN are found in patients with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome, which presents with early-onset hepatocellular carcinoma, premature aging and genomic instability (PMID: 25261934). Patient samples with SPRTN mutations have reduced cell cycle checkpoint control when treated with genotoxic agents (PMID: 25261934).	true	
ENST00000389805	NM_003900	ENST00000389805	NM_003900	8878	SQSTM1	true			SQSTM1, an autophagy adaptor protein, is infrequently altered by translocation in cancer.	SQSTM1 (or p62) is a stress-inducible adaptor protein that regulates the activation of various signaling pathways such as the Nrf2, mTORC1, NF-kB and autophagy signaling pathways via feedback loops (PMID: 22264792, 20452972, 21617040, 24462201, 21258367, 24011591). Multiple kinases, including mTORC1 and MEKK3, phosphorylate SQSTM1 and allow it to bind to ubiquitin-associated proteins (PMID: 24011591). Phosphorylated SQSTM1 then sequesters or degrades via selective autophagy proteins that negatively regulate important signaling pathways, thus activating these pathways (PMID: 25609235). Examples of this are the binding of KEAP1, the negative regulator of Nrf2, or the binding of the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, the negative regulator of NF-kB (PMID: 28842501, PMID: 25609235). SQSTM1, therefore, serves as a regulator for diverse cellular processes such as inflammatory response, antioxidant response, anabolism and catabolism (PMID: 21981924, 10747026, 20173742, 24462201). Accumulation of SQSTM1 promotes tumorigenesis through the overactivation of these cellular processes (PMID: 27345495, 24332042, 27246794). SQSTM1 translocations have been identified in a variety of tumor types including papillary thyroid cancer, ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lung adenocarcinoma (PMID: 28351223, 21134980, 20851865, 33768710).	false

Amplification of SRC is found in colorectal, breast, brain and pancreas cancers, among others.	SRC encodes the c-SRC proto-oncogene, a non-receptor tyrosine protein kinase implicated in cell cycle control, cytokinesis, cell survival/ proliferation and migration/motility (PMID: 25662515). Furthermore, c-SRC has been strongly correlated with a variety of human malignancies including colorectal and breast cancer among others (PMID:19581523). The c-SRC protein consists of a N-terminal myristolation sequence, important for membrane localization and subsequent functionality, followed by an unique SH4 domain, a SH3 domain, a SH2 domain, a linker to the protein-tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (PMID: 8672527). c-SRC is closely related to nine additional non-receptor tyrosine kinases that share homology with c-SRC, the SRC Family Kinases (SFK), which exert similar functions and are also implicated in human cancers (PMID: 25207369, 24948875, 24574860, 24522479, 24388104, 24361441).	false

SRSF2 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2) is an RNA splicing factor that mediates constitutive or alternative splicing of pre-mRNA (PMID: 25965569). As a member of the spliceosome, SRSF2 interacts with splicing factors and mediates mRNA splicing by binding to pre-mRNA via an RNA recognition motif (PMID: 22262462). Loss of SRSF2 expression in cell lines and murine hematopoietic models results in abnormal differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis and mis-splicing of target mRNAs (PMID: 25965569). SRSF2 has also been implicated in the nuclear transport of mRNAs to and from the nucleus (PMID: 22262462). Somatic mutations in SRSF2 have been found in myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and myeloid disorders (PMID: 21909114, 25550361, 25231745, 26464169, 23660863). Alterations in SRSF2 are predominantly heterozygous missense mutations that impact the RNA recognition domain (PMID: 26261309). SRSF2 mutations result in aberrant pre-mRNA splicing at differential splicing enhancer sequences leading to exon misrecognition (PMID: 26124281, 25965569). In hematopoietic cells, key regulatory genes such as EZH2 are mis-spliced in cells with SRSF2 mutations, leading to degradation of EZH2 (PMID: 25965569). Inhibitors of the spliceosome are in preclinical and clinical testing and may be a therapeutic strategy in spliceosome-mutant disease (PMID: 26575690).	false

STAG1 (also SA-1) is a subunit of cohesin, a multi-protein complex that mediates sister chromatid separation during cell division. Cohesin is a ring-shaped structure that regulates sister chromatid cohesion at the centromere from DNA replication to prometaphase during both meiosis and mitosis (PMID: 12034751, 19822671, 21444719). STAG1, or the homolog STAG2, in collaboration with SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21, make up the cohesin ring-structure that surrounds chromatin (PMID: 24856830). During metaphase, cohesin subunits are released from chromosomes leading to the dissolution of cohesion between sister chromatids (PMID: 19056890). STAG1 also binds CTCF, a protein that mediates chromatin looping and has been implicated as a regulator of insulator regions (PMID: 18550811, 27219007). The cohesin complex is also important for other cellular functions including mediating epigenetic state and transcription in post-mitotic cells and regulation of the DNA damage response (PMID: 19056890). Germline mutations in STAG1 are found in cohesinopathies, developmental syndromes associated with loss of cohesin activity (PMID: 28119487). Loss of STAG1 in mice results in transcriptional changes consistent with Cornelia de Lange syndrome and other cohesinopathies (PMID: 22415368). Somatic mutations in STAG1 have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (PMID: 24335498) and these mutations are predicted to be loss-of-function (PMID: 28430577). STAG1 overexpression has also been identified in several human cancers (PMID: 11568975). STAG1 and STAG2 have a synthetic lethal relationship, suggesting that targeting both components could be therapeutically valuable (PMID: 28691904).	true

STAG2 is a component of the cohesin complex that is required for cohesion of the sister chromatids at the centromere after DNA replication in both meiosis and mitosis (PMID: 12034751, 19822671, 21444719). Microduplication of the Xq25 chromosome, containing the locus of STAG2, is seen in some types of cohesinopathies that are characterized by abnormal behavior, intellectual disability, distinctive facial appearance and disorders in speech (PMID: 23637084, 25677961, 25450604, 26443594). Inactivating mutations in STAG2 lead to aneuploidy and chromosomal instability in cancer (PMID: 21852505). Nonsense mutations and deletions of STAG2 are found together in melanoma, Ewing sarcoma, glioblastoma, head and neck carcinoma, bladder carcinoma and myeloid neoplasms, whereas deletions alone are observed in gastric, colorectal and prostate cancers (PMID: 24856830, 21852505, 26122845, 25010205, 24270882, 24121792, 25186949, 22668012, 25223734, 23955599, 25501392, 24121789, 20687102, 24056718, 24335498, 24121791, 25867412). Somatic mutations of STAG2 are observed in myeloid malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, and are associated with worse overall survival and better response to some therapeutic treatments (PMID: 25501392, 25006131, 24335498). STAG2 mutations are prevalent in leukemia patients with IDH2 mutations and are found in more than 95% of patients with secondary leukemia (PMID: 25836588, 25550361). Nonsynonymous mutations are found in glioblastoma, uterine carcinoma and breast carcinoma (PMID: 26352260).

STAT1 is a transcription factor that is activated by cytokine and growth factor stimulation of receptor kinases (PMID: 26631912). Activated non-receptor JAK tyrosine kinases phosphorylate STAT1 in response to receptor kinase stimulation, leading to dimerization and nuclear translocation of STAT complexes (PMID: 22520844). STAT1 functions as a homodimer known as the IFN-gamma activator complex, or heterodimerizes with STAT2 molecules (PMID: 28184222). The latter can complex with interferon-regulated genes such as IRF9 to regulate context-specific transcriptional programs known as the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 or ISGF3 (PMID: 28184222). JAK-STAT signaling is initiated by various cytokines, including interleukin and interferon molecules, which stimulate STAT-mediated transcription in the nucleus (PMID: 29921905). STAT1 signaling is critical for regulation of innate and adaptive immunity, including protection from pathogen infections (PMID: 26631912, 29921905). In addition, STAT1 regulates the expression of the immune recognition molecule MHC-I, which promotes clearance of tumor cells by NK and cytotoxic T cells (PMID: 30796216, 19811323). Loss of STAT1 in murine models results in depleted responses to interferon signaling, leading to aberrant T-cell function (PMID: 30796216). STAT1 also regulates various other cellular functions including differentiation, proliferation and cell death (PMID: 26631912).  Germline, heterozygous, gain-of-function mutations in STAT1 result in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, a malignancy that results in persistent infections (PMID: 22651901, 21714643, 21727188). Somatic mutations in STAT1 are not well-studied in human cancers; however, loss of STAT1 in mammary tumor models promotes tumor progression, suggesting STAT1 may function as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 26631912, 21076615, 21311224).

STAT2 is a transcription factor that is activated by cytokine and growth factor stimulation of receptor kinases (PMID: 27053489). Activated non-receptor JAK tyrosine kinases phosphorylate STAT2 in response to receptor kinase stimulation, leading to dimerization and nuclear translocation of STAT complexes (PMID: 26631912). STAT2 functions as a homodimer or heterodimerizes with STAT1 molecules (PMID: 28184222, 27053489). The latter can complex with interferon-regulated genes such as IRF9 to regulate context-specific transcriptional programs known as the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3, or ISGF3 (PMID: 28184222, 8621447, 31266943). JAK-STAT2 signaling is initiated by various cytokines, including interferon type I (IFN-I) molecules, which stimulate STAT-mediated transcription in the nucleus (PMID: 29921905, 30671054, 28165510). STAT2 signaling is critical for the regulation of anti-viral, immune, apoptotic, and proliferative responses initiated by IFN-I stimulation (PMID: 31605750, 30337919). Loss of STAT2 in murine models leads to deficiencies in various immune cell populations, leading to an ineffective host response to viral infection (PMID: 30134157, 27233962). Germline mutations in STAT2 are found in patients with susceptibility to viral infections due to deficiencies in IFN-I immunity (PMID: 23391734, 28087227, 23391734). STAT2 alterations have also been linked to neurodegeneration following viral infection due to mitochondrial fission defects (PMID: 26122121). Somatic mutations in STAT2 are not well-studied in human cancers; however, STAT2 activity has a critical role in regulating interferon signaling in various contexts in cancer cells (PMID: 30940163, 31605750, 29581268).	false

Non-receptor JAK tyrosine kinases subsequently phosphorylate STAT3, leading to dimerization and nuclear translocation of STAT complexes (PMID: 25527793). STAT3 is involved in regulating development of the skin, central nervous system and mammary tissue (PMID:11994402, 10342556). Activated STAT3 is found in various cancer types, most notably in breast cancer, and is implicated in pathways important for survival, immune dysregulation, tumor microenvironment modulation and invasion (PMID: 25342631, 11420660, 21310826, 16463269). Germline mutations in STAT3 are associated with autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation (PMID: 25359994). STAT3 germline mutations have also been identified in hyper-IgE syndrome characterized by elevated IgE levels, connective tissue abnormalities and immunodeficiency (PMID: 17881745). Somatic activating STAT3 mutations are found in large granular lymphocytic leukemia and more rarely in myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia and lymphomas (PMID: 22591296, 23926297, 25586472).

Activated non-receptor JAK tyrosine kinases subsequently phosphorylate STAT6, leading to the dimerization and nuclear translocation of STAT complexes (PMID: 8085155, 25527793). In the nucleus, STAT6 binds DNA and regulates the expression of a range of transcriptional targets involved in T-cell mediated inflammatory signaling (PMID: 8816495, 20620946). STAT6 activity mediates the development of T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells and IL-4 stimulated T cell responses (PMID: 8624821, 8085155). In addition, STAT6 is involved in a variety of other cellular functions including immunoglobulin class switching in B cells, lymphocyte homeostasis, apoptosis, chromatin state changes and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 8602264, 12023955, 21442426). STAT6 fusions are found in all patients with solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), a metastasizing mesenchymal cancer, and meningeal haemangiopericytoma, a soft tissue sarcoma in the meninges (PMID: 23313952, 29703757, 28295484, 25482924, 23575898).

STK11 encodes serine/threonine kinase 11, also known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1), that functions as a tumor suppressor. STK11 activates the AMPK (adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) pathway via formation of a biologically active heterotrimer with the pseudokinase, STRAD, and the adaptor protein, MO25. Activated AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 and Raptor, which leads mTORC1 hyperactivation (PMID: 14651849, 18439900). STK11-AMPK signaling regulates cell metabolism and energy homeostasis, as well as cellular stress responses to DNA damage and nutrient scarcity (PMID: 21396365). In response to the metabolic stress and hypoxic conditions that often exist within tumors, STK11-AMPK signaling is activated, resulting in inhibition of anabolism, induction of cell cycle arrest and ultimately, suppression of tumor growth (PMID: 25244018). Loss of STK11 has been shown to lead to disorganized cell polarity and tumor growth in nutrient poor conditions. Activation of STK11 by ATM under conditions of DNA damage leads to downstream inhibition of the mTOR pathway (PMID: 20160076). Mutations in STK11 have been found in lung, breast, cervical, testicular, and liver cancers, as well as malignant melanoma, and pancreatic and biliary carcinoma (PMID: 25244018). In addition, the hereditary disease Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, in which STK11 mutations were initially discovered, is characterized by an increased risk of developing both benign and malignant gastrointestinal tumors as well as numerous other cancer types (PMID: 21396365).	true

STK19 encodes for a nuclear DNA-binding protein that was originally misidentified as a serine/threonine kinase (PMID: 9812991). STK19 is located on chromosome 6, close to the major histocompatibility complex, a region frequently associated with several traits in case-control studies (PMID: 21323541, 23263863, 19851445, 23535732, 19423540). Despite being named as a serine/threonine kinase, STK19 has no intrinsic kinase activity and previous research of STK19âs kinase activity is suggested to be due to an STK19-associated kinase (PMID: 32531245, 32531246). STK19 is tightly chromatin-associated, however its functions as a nuclear protein are currently unknown (PMID: 32531245). STK19 is suggested to bind with an unknown kinase, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of NRAS to drive melanomagenesis, which may be sensitive to STK19 small molecule inhibition (PMID: 30712867, 32531246). STK19 mutations have been identified in a subset of skin cancers (PMID: 22817889, 25600636, 25303977).	false

Altered expression of STK40 is found in ovarian and esophageal cancers, among others.	STK40 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 40) is a pseudokinase that functions predominantly as an adaptor signaling molecule (PMID: 26663584,13679039). Structural studies demonstrate that while STK40 has a serine/threonine kinase domain, the protein cannot bind ATP (PMID: 28089446). Overexpression of STK40 inhibits NF-ÎºB activation and p53-mediated transcription, suggesting that STK40 functions as a negative regulator of NF-ÎºB and p53 (PMID:26663584,13679039). STK40 also has been shown to bind the E3 ligase COP1, implicating the adaptor in regulation of protein stability (PMID: 28089446). Loss of STK40 expression in several cell line and murine models suggests a role for STK40 in cell differentiation including in hematopoietic cells and skeletal muscle (PMID: 28358362, 27899448). Somatic mutations in STK40 are infrequent in human cancer, however, STK40 expression has been found to be upregulated in several cancer cell line models (PMID: 26286729).	false

Truncating mutations in SUFU are strongly associated with pediatric medulloblastoma.	SUFU encodes the protein suppressor of fused which is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, one of the key regulators of embryonic development (PMID: 23686138). SUFU can sequester GLI transcription factors in the cytoplasm repressing their activity (PMID: 19055941, 10564661, 10559945). SUFU can repress Wnt signaling by exporting beta-catenin from the nucleus (PMID: 11477086) it also can serve as a point of interaction between the hedgehog and p63 pathways which may be an important part of the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation (PMID: 23686138). SUFU is a tumor-suppressor in which truncating germline or somatic mutations, often accompanied by loss of the wildtype allele, are strongly associated with pediatric medulloblastoma (PMID: 12068298, 24651015). Germline mutations in SUFU can cause Gorlin syndrome (PMID: 25403219). No drugs specifically target SUFU although there are drugs that target the hedgehog signaling pathway (PMID: 23291299).	true

The SUZ12 (Suppressor of Zeste 12) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for transcriptional repression by catalyzing di- and tri-methylation of Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) (PMID: 16630818). SUZ12 is necessary for both the histone methyltransferase activity and silencing function of PRC2 (PMID: 15225548), which are important in regulating development and expression of cell identity genes, including the HOX cluster of genes (PMID: 16625203). SUZ12 is commonly mutated in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myeloid neoplasms (PMID: 25240281, 22237151, 22237106, 23486531). Translocations involving SUZ12 have been identified in endometrial stromal tumors (PMID: 11371647).

Upregulation of SYK is found in lymphomas, leukemias and select epithelial tumors.	SYK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is recruited to the cell membrane through binding of its SH2 domain to membrane receptors and is subsequently activated via phosphorylation (PMID:7538118). SYK is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and activation of SYK-mediated signaling pathways is necessary for B-cell and lymphatic system development (PMID:10963601,17699797, 23609194). In B- and T-cell signal transduction, SYK binds ITAM adaptor molecules that complex with the B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor (TCR) mediating critical immune regulatory pathways (PMID:7477353,12522250). SYK activity is required to activate various other signaling pathways that mediate cellular adhesion, osteoclast maturation, platelet activation and vascular development (PMID: 20467426). Somatic mutations in SYK are rare in human cancers; however, activated SYK signaling has been identified in leukemias and lymphomas (PMID: 24525236,19800574, 26575169, 23764004). In addition, activation of SYK signaling has been described as a mechanism of ovarian cancer chemoresistance (PMID:26096845). Case reports have reported translocations in SYK in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and lymphomas (PMID:11159536,16341044).

SZT2 encodes the seizure threshold 2 homolog protein, which is expressed in the brain, predominantly in the parietal frontal cortex and dorsal root ganglia, and in other tissues at lower levels (PMID: 34685691). Expression of SZT2 in the brain suggests that it may play a role during early brain development through neuronal migration, axon guidance, and synapse formation (PMID: 30970654, 19624305). While its biological function is not fully understood, the SZT2 protein is highly conserved and has been implicated in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and protein quality control. Other potential functions of SZT2 include involvement in calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial function and the cellular stress response pathway (PMID: 30970654). Mutations in the SZT2 gene cause severe epileptic and neurological encephalopathy (PMID: 34685691, 36250465, 28199315, 30970654). SZT2 is a component of the KICSTOR complex which is required for the localization of the GATOR1 complex on the lysosome surface. Both the KICSTOR and GATOR1 complexes act as negative regulators of mTORC1 activity (PMID: 33685991, 30970654). In hematopoietic stem cells, loss of SZT2 causes an elevation of mTORC1 activity and reactive oxygen species production and impairs the repopulating capacity of the cells (PMID: 36250465). Mutations in the SZT2 gene have been identified in patients with PIK3CA-mutated ER+ breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (PMID: 33685991, 30970654).	false

TAL1 (also SCL) is a transcription factor that is a member of the class II basic helix-loop-helix family (bLHL) (PMID: 28179281). TAL1 is expressed in many hematopoietic cell types including hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitors, megakaryocytes, and erythroid cells; however, TAL1 is silenced in lymphoid lineages (PMID: 7678994, 28179281). Like other bLHL transcription factors, TAL1 functions as a heterodimer with class I bHLH transcription factors and binds E-box motifs to regulate gene expression (PMID: 9214632). TAL1 regulates the activity of numerous genes via interaction with other hematopoietic transcription factors including LMO2, GATA1, LDB1, RUNX1, ETS family proteins, among others (PMID: 20887958). Binding of TAL1 across the genome is distinct depending on hematopoietic cell type, suggesting that TAL1 transcriptional regulation is context dependent (PMID: 21179004). In addition, TAL1 likely has additional roles in the activation of transcription factor partners beyond the role in DNA binding (PMID: 10498694). Loss of TAL1 in mice results in the absence of blood formation during early hematopoietic development and the depletion of differentiated hematopoietic cells in adults, demonstrating that TAL1 is critical in early hematopoietic lineage specification (PMID: 7830794, 8689686). TAL1 overexpression is common in patients in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and recurrent translocations that result in TAL1 activation are also found in T-ALL, suggesting that TAL1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 19562638, 21057528).	false

TBL1XR1 (also TBLR1) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing protein family (PMID: 26069883). TBL1XR1 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by binding the NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor)/SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors) complex and mediates histone deacetylation at target genes (PMID: PMID: 26069883). TBL1XR1, in collaboration with TBL1X, stabilizes the NCoR/SMRT complex on chromatin via interactions with histone H2B and H4 (PMID: 28687524, 18202150). In addition, TBL1XR1 mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the NCoR/SMRT complexes after ligand binding to nuclear receptors (PMID: 26069883, 14980219). Ligand binding initiates activation of several hormone receptors, including the androgen receptor and retinoic acid receptor (PMID: 26069883, 16893456).

TCF3 is a member of the E protein family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors (Transcription factor 3, E2A immunoglobulin enhancer-binding factors E12/E47), which activate transcription by binding to regulatory E-box sequences on target genes. TCF3 expression is essential for lymphopoiesis, and B and T lymphocyte development. It has been shown to play a role in repressing Wnt signaling, specifically beta-catenin expression, during neuronal differentiation and proliferation of neural precursor cells (PMID 24832538, 21730189). Together with p53, TCF3 enforces p21 expression and cell-cycle arrest in response to genotoxic stress (PMID: 23684607). Its deletions or diminished protein activity have been associated with several lymphoid malignancies, including pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukuemia, childhood leukemia and acute leukemia (PMID: 12700034). The TCF3 locus is a common target of chromosome rearrangements in diverse leukemias, leading to E2A chimeric proteins (PMID: 17311319, 17593026, 11588043, 11243406).	true

TCF7L2 (also known as TCF4) is a transcription factor that positively regulates the WNT/beta-catenin pathway (PMID: 22934027, 23260145). WNT-ligand induced pathway activation results in destabilization of the beta-catenin destruction complex, leading to stabilization of beta-catenin. TCF7L2 forms a bipartite transcription factor complex in the nucleus with beta-catenin to activate WNT-dependent target genes (PMID: 22934027). Loss of TCF7L2 activity in murine models results in reduced hepatic glucose production and dysregulation of metabolic gene expression programs (PMID: 23260145). TCF7L2 has also been found to regulate gene expression programs in a variety of cell types that impact cellular proliferation and metabolism (PMID: 26955760, 29301589, 29190896, 18289012). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within TCF7L2 has been identified as the most significant genetic marker associated with risk of Type 2 diabetes (PMID: 22872755) and gestational diabetes (PMID: 23690305). Germline mutations in TCF7L2 have been associated with predisposition to colorectal cancer (PMID: 18398040, 18478343) and genome-wide sequencing studies have identified TCF7L2 frameshift mutations in colorectal cancer (PMID: 8621708). TCF7L2 is hypothesized to function as a tumor suppressor by repressing cell growth-promoting genes in several contexts (PMID: 18621708).	true

TCL1A is a signaling molecule that is a member of the T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma 1 (TCL1) protein family (PMID: 16056259, 30151355). TCL1A is predominantly expressed during development and in immature lymphocytes (PMID: 12181493, 15479728). TCL1A functions as an intracellular protein that stabilizes AKT heterodimers at the cytoplasmic membrane, augments effector signaling and mediates AKT nuclear localization (PMID: 10716693, 10983986). The concentration of TCL1A proteins is important to regulate signaling pathways that control proliferation, survival, and immune regulation (PMID: 10716693, 10983986, 9285687). TCL1A also interacts with a variety of proteins including NF-ÎºB, Hsp70, ATM, TP63, and DNMT3A, among others, implicating TCL1A in the regulation of additional cellular activities (PMID: 19668332, 23160471, 22065599, 29048125, 22308499). In murine models, increased expression of TCL1A results in the transformation of B and T cells, leading to the development of T-cell leukemias (PMID: 9520462, 12011454, 12672960). Overexpression of TCL1A in T- and B-cell malignancies are common, suggesting that TCL1A predominantly functions as an oncogene (PMID: 9407948, 16056259). Rearrangements involving TCL1A are recurrent in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), typically due to aberrant VDJ recombination of T-cell receptor genes and leading to TCL1A activation (PMID: 3258192).	false

TENT5C is a protein that belongs to the group XXV nucleotidyltransferase superfamily and functions as a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase (PMID: 27060136). TENT5C expression has been shown to regulate cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and regulation of RAS/MAPK signaling (PMID: 28341836). Loss-of-function TENT5C mutations and deletions have been identified in multiple myeloma, suggesting that TENT5C is a tumor suppressor (PMID: 21430775, 26282654, 20616218, 24434212).

The TERT promoter is frequently mutated in various cancer types.	The TERT gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains telomere length and genomic integrity. TERT expression is low or absent in somatic cells; however, telomerase activity is upregulated in a vast majority of tumors and likely contributes to cancer cell immortality (PMID: 24657534, 9282118). Sequencing of the TERT promoter identified activating mutations in a number of cancer types including melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, medulloblastoma and glioma (PMID: 23348506, 23530248). Tumors with highly recurrent TERT promoter mutations tend to originate from tissues with lower rates of self-renewal (PMID: 23530248). TERT promoter mutations, C228T and C250T, account for the majority of the somatic TERT promoter alterations and occur 124 and 146 base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon of TERT, respectively. Both promoter mutations create binding motifs for erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS)/ T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factors and enhance telomerase activity (PMID: 23348503, 23348506, 26194807). In addition to promoter mutations, TERT, located on chromosome 5p, is amplified across many cancer types (PMID: 20164920).	false

TET1 is infrequently mutated in solid tumors.	TET1 is an iron- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme that is involved in converting 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (PMID: 19372391). This conversion of the DNA base to 5hmC is the initial step in active DNA methylation, which is important in gene regulation, cellular reprogramming, and mammalian development (PMID: 20639862). TET enzyme activity is inhibited by 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an inhibitory metabolite produced by specific mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 whose production results in a highly specific DNA methylation profile and is often found in certain glioblastomas and leukemias (PMID: 21383741). TET1 was first identified as a translocation partner of the MLL gene and a key oncogenic driver in acute myeloid leukemias (PMID: 23818607). Reduced TET1 expression has also been observed in various human cancers. In breast cancer, reduced TET1 levels were shown to associate with increased tumor growth and metastasis (PMID: 23716660), and in colon cancer cell lines, reduced TET1 expression was associated with an aberrant CpG methylation profile and WNT pathway activation (PMID: 27977763, 25362856). Reduced TET1 expression has also been associated with KRAS-induced cellular transformation (PMID: 25466250).	true

TET2 belongs to a family of alpha-ketoglutarate and iron-dependent enzymes involved in converting 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (PMID: 19372391). This modification is implicated in active DNA demethylation, a process that is important for cellular reprogramming and gene regulation (PMID: 20639862). TET2 has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor with mutations leading to loss-of-function, particularly those affecting the C-terminal catalytic domain (PMID: 21057493). In animal models, TET2 loss cooperates with other mutations such as JAK2 and FLT3-ITD mutations to promote cancer progression and can induce genomic hypermethylation and increase stem cell self-renewal (PMID:21723200, 25281607, 25873173, 25886910). TET2 mutations are most often found in hematologic malignancies (PMID: 24220273). Isolated mutations in TET2 have also been found in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis but with no apparent hematologic disease (PMID: 23001125). However, these patients are at a higher risk of developing hematologic cancer with aging (PMID: 25426837, 25426838). TET family enzyme activity is also inhibited by specific mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 that produce an inhibitory co-factor, 2-hydroxyglutarate (PMID: 21130701). Mutations in WT1 may also affect TET2 function as an associated co-factor (PMID: 25482556, 25601757).	true

The 5-hmc modification is implicated in active DNA demethylation, a process that is important for cellular reprogramming and gene regulation (PMID: 20639862). The TET enzymes, including TET1 and TET2, are also involved in the oxidation of 5-mc to other cytosine derivatives (PMID: 21778364). TET3 also bind O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and REST to promote the binding of methyltransferases to chromatin (PMID: 23353889, 24304661, 25843715). In addition, TET3 physically associates with WT1 to mediate DNA methylation in leukemic cells (PMID: 25482556 ). TET-mediated hydroxymethylation has been implicated in a variety of cellular process including the regulation of somatic cell reprogramming (PMID: 24529596), hematopoietic differentiation (PMID: 24619230, 26257178), DNA damage response (PMID: 28325772), and telomere elongation (PMID: 25223896). Altered TET family member expression and 5-hmc levels have been correlated with tumor progression and prognosis in a variety of cancer types (PMID: 23671639, 26207381, 27848178). Somatic loss-of-function mutations in TET3 have been found in myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia and colon cancer, among others (PMID: 19388938, 19420352, 22895193, 28452984, 29531217).

When nutrients are abundant, TFE3 is retained in the cytoplasm by mTORC1 phosphorylation and binding to the scaffolding protein 14-3-3 (PMID: 24448649). Activity and localization of TFE3 are also mediated by Rag GTPases, under control of the amino acid sensor Ragulator (PMID: 24448649, 22980980). In response to nutrient deprivation, TFE3 regulates the number of lysosomes in the cell (PMID: 24448649). TFE3 translocates to the nucleus upon starvation and upregulates a variety of genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis (PMID: 24448649, 22576015). In addition, TFE3 mediates a variety of immune-related activities including autophagy, proinflammatory cytokine expression and antibody production, among others (PMID: 26813791, 26813791, 30917316). Expression of TFE3 is implicated in hematopoietic and osteoclast differentiation (PMID: 17046750, 23599343). Overexpression of TFE3 is found in patients with pancreatic cancer, resulting in increased lysosomal function to maintain intracellular amino acid pools (PMID: 26168401). Oncogenic fusion proteins that place TFE3 downstream of a strong promoter are found in an aggressive subtype of renal cell carcinoma and alveolar soft part sarcomas, a rare soft tissue tumor (PMID: 22705279, 8872474, 30849994).	false

In prostate cancer, specific FOXA1 mutations disrupt an interaction with TLE3, resulting in loss of TLE3-mediated repression of WNT signaling and metastasis (PMID: 31243372).	false

TLE4 is a transcriptional co-repressor that is a member of the Groucho (Gro)/Transductin-like enhancer (TLE) of split family proteins (PMID: 27852056). The TLE family of transcriptional regulators cannot bind DNA but function as adaptor proteins that modulate the activity of transcription factors, such as RUNX, NKX, and WNT family transcription factors (PMID: 27852056, 27486062, 10825294). TLE4 functions as a homotetramer or heterooligomer that recruits both epigenetic and transcriptional effector proteins to DNA to allow for remodeling of chromatin and repression of gene expression (PMID: 22169276). TLE4 binds cofactors that mediate the activity of several signaling pathways including NOTCH and WNT (PMID: 27486062, 15499562). Expression of TLE4 has been implicated in a variety of cellular activities including cell fate specification, immune regulation, neuronal development, metastasis and inflammation, among others (PMID: 30045946, 29395907, 27486062, 25153823). TLE4 can function as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene in different cancer types, suggesting that TLE4 has context-specific roles in cancer progression. The TLE4 gene is located in the 9q region that is commonly deleted in acute myeloid leukemia, while loss of TLE4 expression has found to be growth promoting in other cancer types such as colorectal cancer (PMID: 26701208, 18258796).	false

TLX1 (also HOX11) is a transcription factor that is a member of the NK-like subfamily of homeobox genes (PMID: 19835636). TLX1 functions predominantly as a transcriptional repressor at T-cell lineage-specific enhancers and antagonizes NOTCH1 (PMID: 26108691). In collaboration with the transcription factor STAT5, TLX1 binds enhancer regions of genes that drive leukemic gene expression programs including BCL2 and MYC (PMID: 19835636). TLX1 is not expressed in the hematopoietic system; however, TLX1 activation is observed in several hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 21326611). Transcriptional activity of TLX1 has been associated with several cellular functions including transformation, mitotic checkpoint control, and genome stability (PMID: 20972433, 9009195, 7905617). TLX1 downregulates the mitotic checkpoint gene CHEK2, leading to aneuploidy in TLX1-positive human and murine leukemic tumors (PMID: 20972433). Expression of TLX1 in several distinct murine models results in the development of T-ALL, with T cells typically arresting at the cortical stage of development (PMID: 20972433, 21326611). Recurrent TLX1 fusions are found in patients with T-acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) (PMID: 1676542). These rearrangements place TLX1 under the control of T-cell strong enhancers, suggesting that TLX1 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 27451956).	false

TLX3 (also HOX11L2) is a transcription factor that is a member of the NK-like subfamily of homeobox genes (PMID: 19835636). Expression of TLX3 is highest in the central nervous system, where it mediates glutamatergic neuronal differentiation (PMID: 11581159, 15064766, 27452274). TLX3 also functions as a transcriptional repressor at T-cell lineage-specific enhancers, similar to the closely related family member TLX1 (PMID: 30107177, 22516263, 22366949). TLX3 is not expressed in the hematopoietic system; however, TLX3 activation is found in leukemias (PMID: 12086890, 12454747). Expression of TLX3 in hematopoietic assays demonstrates restricted T cell differentiation at the cortical stage, likely due to transcriptional interactions with ETS1 and reduced T-cell receptor activity (PMID: 22516263). TLX3 mediates the expression of genes involved in T-cell differentiation and interacts with chromatin modifiers to regulate transcription (PMID: 29296717, 26258652). Transcriptional activity of TLX3 has been associated with several cellular functions including transformation, proliferation, and invasion (PMID: 16804919, 29296717). Recurrent TLX3 fusions are found in patients with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) (PMID: 27451956, 28671688). These rearrangements lead to TLX3 activation by positioning TLX3 under the control of T-cell mediated regulatory units, suggesting that TLX3 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 27451956).	false

TMEM127 (transmembrane protein 127) encodes a tumor suppressor protein with three predicted transmembrane domains. In vitro experiments confirm the localization of TMEM127 at the plasma membrane and indicate a tumor-suppressor role through reduction of mTORC1 activity, demonstrated by phosphorylation of the mTOR effector, S6K, upon TMEM127 depletion (PMID: 20923864, 20154675, 21156949). The latter has also been shown in a tissue sample from a patient with pheochromocytoma (PMID: 20923864). Cell line studies suggest that the failure of mutated TMEM127 to inhibit mTORC1 is due to loss of association with the mTOR inhibitor RAB5. Truncating germline variants in TMEM127, often in concert with loss of heterozygosity at its genomic locus, confer increased risk for pheochromocytoma and paraganglial tumors (PMID: 20923864, 20154675, 21156949, 22541004, 21613359).

TMPRSS2 is a transmembrane serine protease that functions to cleave substrates in epithelial cells. Although its role in normal epithelial cells is not well understood, TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in the prostate epithelium and is an androgen responsive gene (PMID:11245484). TMPRSS2 can cleave components of the tumor microenvironment, such as pro-HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) to promote invasion and metastasis (PMID: 25122198). TMPRSS2 is recurrently fused to ETS-family transcription factors in about 50% of primary prostate cancers, including the TMPRSS2-ERG and TMPRSS2-ETV1 fusions, resulting in overexpression of these ETS family members (PMID: 16254181). TMPRSS2 gene fusions in prostate cancer often occur in the setting of PTEN loss and subsequent PI3-kinase pathway activation (PMID:19396168,19396167). In these cancers, ETS transcription factors modify the chromatin landscape of prostate cancer cells, allowing for increased androgen receptor (AR) binding and priming prostate cancer initiation in response to PTEN loss (PMID: 23817021, 28783165).	false

Mutations of TNFAIP3 are found in lymphomas and leukemias.	TNFAIP3 encodes TNF alpha induced protein 3 that is induced by Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and regulates the NF-ÎºB pathway (PMID: 11009421). TNFAIP3 has ubiquitin ligase and de-ubiquitination activities that suppress the NF-ÎºB pathway (PMID: 15258597). Its activity is important in regulating B-cell survival and apoptosis, inflammatory response, and dendritic cell function in regulating T-cells (PMID: 20705491, 18311150, 25043000). Polymorphisms in TNFAIP3 are associated with many autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (PMID:19165919, 25684197, 24097067,17982455). Germline loss of function mutations are associated with autoimmune disease (PMID: 26642243). Mutations are found in B-cell lymphomas, T-cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia, and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PMID: 19412163, 21115979, 21625233, 26199174).

TNFRSF14 (also HVEM) is a cell surface receptor in the tumor necrosis factor family (PMID: 8898196). It is expressed on several types of cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid cells, as well as non-lymphoid organs including lung, liver and kidney (PMID: 9162061). TNFRSF14 is a tumor suppressor and immunogenicity regulation factor and is capable of sending both stimulatory and inhibitory signals to T cells depending on the particular ligand it binds (PMID: 23023713, 20884631). Mutations in TNFRSF14 has been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PMID: 22343534 ) and follicular lymphoma (FL) (PMID: 20884631, 24435047, 24162788, 21941365). These mutations are associated with high-risk clinical features, and patients with a mutation in TNFRSF14 responded poorly to rituximab (PMID: 20884631). Recurrent copy number loss of the region containing TNFRSF14 was observed in 42% of the cases with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) (PMID:26650888). Finally, TNFRSF14 expression is deregulated in colorectal cancer (PMID: 25750286), hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 25468715) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (PMID:24249528).	true

TNFSF13, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family, encodes the proliferation-inducing ligand for the TNF receptors TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF17 (PMID: 33036273, 30131941). Through binding these receptors, TNFSF13 functions in B cell and T cell activation, survival and proliferation to regulate humoral immunity response (PMID: 19828625, 10973284, 14707116). TNFSF13 has been identified to have three transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms as a result of alternative splicing (PMID: 10706119). Overexpression of TNFSF13 in mouse models and cancer cell lines induces increased tumor growth, migration and proliferation, suggesting that TNFSF13 functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 24436270, 17190854, 19573525, 16793914, 30819903). Amplification of TNFSF13 can also be accompanied by the amplification of driver oncogenes, such as EGFR and PDK4, and the deletion and mutation of tumor suppressor genes, such as CDKN2A and PTEN (PMID: 34712225). TNFSF13 overexpression and mutation has been identified in various cancers, including breast cancer and multiple myeloma (PMID: 18366696, 30135465, 25750171).	false

TONSL encodes the Tonsoku-like DNA repair protein, which is a multi-domain scaffold protein that plays a critical role in resistance to replication stress and maintaining genome integrity. TONSL interacts with various DNA replication and repair factors including anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1), minichromosome maintenance complex component helicases (MCM helicases), H3 and H4 histones and methanesulfonate sensitivity protein 22-like protein (MMS22L) (PMID: 32959051, 30773278). TONSL, in a heterodimer complex with MMS22L, is involved in repairing spontaneous DNA lesions through homologous recombination (PMID: 30773278). The MMS22L-TONSL complex functions in the DNA damage response upon replication fork collapse and to mediate recovery from replicative stress (PMID: 36622344, 37057595). The MMS22L-TONSL complex is recruited by replication protein A (RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3) to sites of stalled replication forks during normal S-phase replication and promotes homologous recombination by facilitating the assembly of RAD51 (PMID 30773278, 30773277, 32959051). TONSL is thought to negatively regulate NF-kappa-B by binding to NF-kappa-B complexes and trapping them in the cytoplasm, preventing them from interacting with DNA ((PMID: 30723051, 31158361). NF-kappa-B complexes can then enter the nucleus upon phosphorylation and ubiquitination of TONSL (PMID: 30723051). Overexpression of TONSL in human gastric cancer cell lines reduces cellular proliferation and colony formation and negatively regulates migration and invasion compared to control cells (PMID: 31158361). Breast primary cells overexpressing TONSL have demonstrated upregulated DNA repair via homologous recombination (PMID: 37057595). Amplification of the TONSL gene is found in breast, liver, lung, esophageal, and cervical cancer (PMID: 37057595, 30723051, 31158361) and mutations in TONSL have been identified in individuals with Sponastrime dysplasia (PMID 32959051, 30773278).	false

TOP1 (DNA topoisomerase 1) is a DNA topoisomerase that catalyzes the decatenation of DNA entanglements that occur during transcription (PMID: 12042765). This transesterification reaction results in the breaking of a DNA strand and subsequent rejoining (PMID: 25693836). Amplification of TOP1 in yeast and cancer cell lines induces genomic instability and susceptibility to DNA damage, suggesting that TOP1 functions primarily an oncogene (PMID: 11353773, 28961461, 36170822). TOP1 overexpression has been identified in various cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer and liver cancer (PMID: 33144457, 26207989, 30132517). TOP1 amplification may be sensitive to treatment with TOP1 inhibitors, such as evodiamine and nitidine chloride (PMID: 26207989, 30132517). Acquired mutations in TOP1 have been identified to confer resistance to TOP1 inhibition (PMID: 21619602, 23836376, 11844605, 16546964, 21978643).	false

TP63 is a member of the TP53 family of transcription factors. The TP63 protein exists as two different isoforms due to usage of alternative promoters, producing variants with (TAp63) and without (ÎNp63) the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) (PMID: 23344544). TP63 transactivates downstream target genes in collaboration with TP53 and TP73, however, the TAp63 and ÎNp63 isoforms have opposing cellular functions (PMID: 24488880). TAp63 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor and plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, response to DNA damage, suppression of metastasis, and transactivation of TP53 family target genes (PMID: 16601753, 21760596). ÎNp63 antagonizes TP53/TAp63/TP73 transactivation of target genes by competing for TAp63 binding sites and blocking transactivation, leading to cellular proliferation (PMID: 23344544). ÎNp63 has been shown to inhibit oxidative-stress induced death and inhibits apoptosis (PMID: 29212036). TP63 is most highly expressed in epithelial cells and neurons and loss of TP63 in mouse models result in depletion of epithelial patterning (PMID: 10227293, 10227294). Expression of TP63 has also been identified as a stem cell marker in several contexts (PMID: 23344544). Germline alterations in TP63 have been associated with several disorders including ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/ palate syndrome (EEC) and limb mammary syndrome (LMS), among others; however, these patients do not have increased cancer risk (PMID: 17224651). Somatic mutations in TP63 are relatively infrequent in human malignancies. However, TP63 has been associated with overexpression and amplification in squamous tumors (PMID: 15754296). Translocations of TP63 have also been found in hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 24893616, 22496164).	true	
				6955	TRA	true			TRA, the Î±-chain of the T-cell receptor, is recurrently altered by chromosomal rearrangement in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	TRA is the T-cell receptor A locus which encodes the Î±-chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR) (PMID: 29261409, 25484883). TCRs are protein complexes found on the surface of T cells that engage antigens associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on antigen presenting cells (PMID: 16087711). T cells are important in coordinating effector and memory immune responses in response to antigen display (PMID: 24292902). MHC class I molecules are recognized by TCRs on CD8+ T cells and MHC class II molecules are recognized by TCRs on CD4+ T cells (PMID: 6504140, 25484883). Most TCRs are composed of Î± and Î² heterodimers (encoded by TRA and TRB), with a fraction of TCRs composed of Î³ and Î´ subunits (PMID: 29261409, 20164930). TRA proteins share substantial homology to immunoglobulin proteins and exhibit sequence diversity following recombination and thymic selection (PMID: 24830344). Engagement of antigen-presenting MHC class proteins with TRA/TRB heterodimers results in conformational changes and activation of downstream pathways leading to activation of TCR-mediated signaling (PMID: 29261409). TRA rearrangements are recurrently found in patients with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias, typically leading to activation of the fusion partner (PMID: 29279377, 28671688). Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is FDA-approved for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in which cancer cells from patients are engineered to express TCRs that are recognized by the immune system (PMID: 29914976, 29539277, 29113977).	false

Mutations are found in meyloma, lymphomas, and more rarely in epithelial cancers.	TRAF2 is an adaptor molecule that interacts with and transduces signals from the Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (PMID:8565075, 8985011, 8898208). Following TNF engagement, TRAF2 mediates the assembly of signaling scaffolds to activate the NF-ÎºB pathway, JNK (Jun amino-terminal kinases), and anti-apoptotic pathways (PMID:8565075, 8985011, 8898208). TRAF2 also has ubiquitin ligase activity that can regulate protein stability (PMID: 23142077, 20577214). Signaling cascades mediated by TRAF2 have been implicated in lymphocyte proliferation and survival, immune response, and hematopoietic stem cell activation (PMID: 9390693, 9390694, 11435475). In cell line and murine cancer models, TRAF2 expression is involved in NF-ÎºB activation leading to tumor cell survival and resistance to targeted therapy (PMID: 25843712,19336568, 22589389). Somatic mutations in TRAF2 have been identified multiple myeloma, lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal carcinomas (PMID:17692805, 24362935,19412164, 23868181). TRAF2 mutations are predicted to be loss-of-function and dysregulate NF-ÎºB signaling (PMID: 24362935,19412164, 23868181).

TRAF3 is an E3 ligase and signaling molecule that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNFR)-associated factor (TRAF) family (PMID: 21660053). TRAF3 functions downstream of Interleukin-1 (IL-1) or Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, which are important in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation (PMID: 21660053). TRAF3 can function as an E3 ligase in TLR pathways, promoting K63-linked polyubiquitination in order to maintain protein-protein interactions (PMID: 21660053, 25847972). Alternatively, TRAF3 can function as a negative regulator of cytokine activity by binding MAPK effectors; degradation of TRAF3 releases MAPK-regulatory proteins, such as MAP3K1, leading to MAPK pathway activation (PMID: 30140268). In addition, TRAF3 can bind TRAF2 and cIAPs to negatively regulate the NF-ÎºB pathway, and TRAF3 degradation results in the release of NF-ÎºB effector molecules, such as NIK (PMID: 21660053, 15383523). TRAF3 also positively regulates the expression of IRF3 and IRF7, proteins that activate the transcription of type I interferon cytokines (PMID: 16306937). Loss of TRAF3 results in the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (PMID: 16306937) and reduced B cell homeostasis (PMID: 17723217). TRAF3 can also bind CD40, a costimulatory protein on T cells that is required for T cell activation, and the TRAF3/CD40 interaction mediates class switching (PMID: 8934568, 12354380). Alterations of TRAF3 have been associated with immune deficiencies in response to primary infection (PMID: 20832341). Loss-of-function mutations in TRAF3 are found in multiple myeloma (PMID: 17692804, 17692805), resulting in activation of NF-ÎºB signaling.

TRAF5 functions as an adaptor molecule in signaling complexes that negatively regulate TLR signaling, in part by activating downstream signaling cascades and mediating cytokine signaling (PMID: 10623461). TRAF5 predominantly acts as an adaptor molecule that binds a complex including TRAF2, leading to activation of downstream NF-ÎºB, JNK and MAPK signaling pathways (PMID: 8790348, 8999898). In addition, TRAF5 can also bind CD40, a costimulatory protein on T cells that is required for T cell activation (PMID: 8790348). An interaction between TRAF2 and TRAF5 is also associated with inhibition of JAK kinase dimerization, leading to inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling (PMID: 29668931). TRAF5 has also been implicated in the regulation of inflammation, as loss of TRAF5 leads to a marked reduction in immune cell infiltration in several tissue types (PMID: 29596835). Mutations in TRAF5 are relatively rare in human cancers; however, loss-of-function alterations have been identified in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PMID: 19412164).	true

TRAF7 is an E3 ligase and signaling molecule that is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family (PMID: 27808423). TRAF7 activity is important for the regulation of the MAPK and NF-kB signal transduction pathways (PMID: 27808423). TRAF7 binds and potentiates the activity of MEKK3, a protein implicated in the activation of downstream MAPK and NF-kB signaling (PMID: 15001576). Additional functional studies have demonstrated that TRAF7 can mediate the stability of several NF-kB pathway members including NEMO and p65 (PMID: 21518757). TRAF7 has also been identified as an agonist for the JNK-AP1 pathway (PMID: 14743216). In addition, TRAF7 targets ubiquitination of c-FLIP, an antiapoptotic molecule, as well as p53, implicating TRAF7 in apoptosis and cellular proliferation (PMID:14743216, 23128672). Recurrent somatic mutations in TRAF7 have been identified meningiomas, including in 93% of secretory meningiomas (PMID: 23348505, 23404370), and predominantly occur as loss-of-function mutations. TRAF7 mutations commonly co-occur with KLF4 and AKT1 mutations and are mutually exclusive with NF2 alterations (PMID: 23404370). TRAF7 is also mutated in Merkel cell carcinomas and mesotheliomas (PMID: 27808423, 26655088).	false

TRB is the T-cell receptor B locus which encodes the Î²-chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR) (PMID: 29261409, 25484883). TCRs are protein complexes found on the surface of T cells that engage antigens associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on antigen presenting cells (PMID: 16087711). T cells are important in coordinating effector and memory immune responses in response to antigen display (PMID: 24292902). MHC class I molecules are recognized by TCRs on CD8+ T cells and MHC class II molecules are recognized by TCRs on CD4+ T cells (PMID: 6504140, 25484883). Most TCRs are composed of Î± and Î² heterodimers (encoded by TRA and TRB), with a fraction of TCRs composed of Î³ and Î´ subunits (PMID: 29261409, 20164930). TRB proteins share substantial homology to immunoglobulin proteins and exhibit sequence diversity following recombination and thymic selection (PMID: 24830344).

Î³Î´ T-cells are unconventional in that that recognize non-peptide stress antigens in the absence of MHC molecules (PMID: 20539306). Î³Î´ T-cell responses are commonly initiated following stress, leading to cytokine production, inflammatory responses, and pathogen clearance via direct or indirect cytotoxic activity (PMID: 28713381, 20539306). TRD proteins undergo programming during thymic maturation, restricting the expression of specific TCRs (PMID: 20539306). Engagement of antigens with TRD/TRG heterodimers results in conformational changes and activation of downstream pathways leading to activation of TCR-mediated signaling (PMID: 29261409).

TRIB3 encodes for a pseudokinase that functions primarily in the regulation of the integrated stress response in the endoplasmic reticulum (PMID: 15775988, 15781252). TRIB3 inhibits the transcriptional activity of DDIT3 and ATF4, nuclear proteins that function in programmed cell death and regeneration, and upregulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway through binding at both the C-terminal and N-terminal regions of TRIB3 (PMID: 15775988, 33717256, 33896816). TRIB3 has also been identified to stabilize and inhibit the ubiquitination of TWIST1, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factor (PMID: 31235507). Overexpression of TRIB3 in various cancer cell lines and mouse models induces upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2, JAG1 and SMAD3, and increases cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that TRIB3 functions predominantly as an oncogene (PMID: 23319603, 23632994, 30745845).

TRIM27, also known as RFP, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is part of the zinc finger protein superfamily, and contains a tripartite motif that consists of a RING finger, B-box zinc finger and coiled-coil domain (PMID: 9247190). TRIM27 induces the ubiquitination of proteins such as PTEN, RIP1 and JAK1 to regulate signaling pathways, which includes promoting the PI3K/AKT and NF-kB signaling pathways (PMID: 30143645, 27612028, 26607717, 31719796, 34284744). Overexpression of TRIM27 in cancer cell lines results in tumor invasion, metastasis and cell proliferation, suggesting that TRIM27 predominantly functions as an oncogene (PMID: 29767249, 31719796). TRIM27 amplification has been identified in various cancer types, including colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer (PMID: 23342271, 29767249).

TRIP13 (also PCH2) is an ATP hydrolase that is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family (PMID: 24367111, 26832417). TRIP13 is localized to the nucleolus and mediates strand invasion and crossover events that occur during homologous chromosome segregation in meiosis (PMID: 17696610, 20711356). TRIP13 is required for the appropriate distribution of meiotic proteins along chromosomes that mediate a variety of functions including crossover formation, double-strand break (DSB) repair, mitotic checkpoint regulation, synaptonemal complex formation and higher order chromatin regulation (PMID: 19851446, 19851446, 22072981, 25092294, 23382701, 25012665, 26324890). Importantly, TRIP13 regulates the switch of the checkpoint protein MAD2 from an active to inactive conformation (PMID: 25918846, 29208896, 29973720). Loss of TRIP13 results in spermatocyte death and recombination defects in murine models (PMID: 17696610, 20711356, 25768017,10319812, 25768017). In addition, increased expression of TRIP13 in cell lines results in transformation, enhanced error-prone nonhomologous end joining and chemoresistance (PMID: 25078033). Biallelic loss-of-function mutations are found in patients with Wilms tumors (PMID: 28553959). Patient samples with TRIP13 mutations have impaired spindle assembly checkpoint function and chromosomal missegregation (PMID: 28553959). Overexpression of TRIP13 is also found in several tumor types including colorectal, head and neck squamous cancer (PMID: 28105232, 25078033, 28968952, 28424416, 28157697, 29567476). TRIP13 is also included in an amplified region in non-small cell lung cancer, suggesting that TRIP13 may function both as a tumor suppressor and oncogene (PMID: 18328944).	true

TSC1 (also hamartin) is a key negative regulator of the pro-oncogenic mTOR signaling pathway (PMID: 23485365, 20301399, 10205261). The mTOR signaling pathway has a central role in promoting cellular growth and regulating protein synthesis. TSC1 acts as a scaffold to form a heteromeric complex with TBC1D7 and TSC2; the resulting TSC complex functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) and inhibits RHEB (PMID: 22795129, 24529379, 24714658), which is a GTPase that functions as a small molecular switch, activating mTORC1 when bound to GTP (PMID: 24863881). Both TSC1 and TSC2 are also phosphorylated by several kinases (e.g., AKT, RSK1, ERK, AMPK, and GSK3) thus providing regulatory inhibition of the mTOR pathway via several different signaling pathways (PMID: 16959574). Germline mutations in TSC1 are associated with tuberous sclerosis, a disorder that results in benign and occasionally malignant tumor growths (PMID: 23485365, 9242607). Somatic TSC1 mutations have been identified in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, and predominantly present as truncating loss-of-function mutations (PMID: 25526364).

TSHR (thyroid stimulating hormone receptor) is a transmembrane protein that binds thyrotropin and thyrostimulin (PMID: 2556796). TSHR is expressed in the thyroid gland and regulates the growth of thyroid cells and the release of thyroid hormone (PMID:24931193). It belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors (PMID: 18719020). Activation of the receptor results higher cAMP levels, increased Protein Kinase A activity and phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors such as cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB) (PMID:11158328). TSHR may also activate other pathways including the RAS-MAPK, Protein Kinase C, and NFkB pathways (PMID: 11039907, 15062572, 18719020). Germline activating mutations result in hyperthyroidism while loss-of-function mutations lead to hypothyroidism (PMID: 7920658, 23154162, 20926595). Activating mutations are found in thyroid carcinomas (PMID:7478621,26260781).

TYK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the JAK kinase family (PMID: 17721432, 18682296). TYK2 requires a cognate cytokine receptor to initiate extracellular cytokine signaling cascades, including interferon signaling (PMID: 24654603). Activation of TYK2 leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as STAT3/5 and MAPK, enabling the translocation of these signaling molecules to the nucleus to activate transcription (PMID: 29162862, 28295194). TYK2 is an important mediator of inflammation and loss of TYK2 in murine models results in reduced cytokine responses (PMID: 11070173). Mutations in TYK2 have been identified in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), a malignancy in which patients have increased mycobacterial and viral infections due to impaired cytokine signaling (PMID: 26304966). Fusion proteins containing TYK2 have been identified in patients with hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 25207766). Germline mutations in TYK2 have been found in acute myeloid leukemia patients; however, somatic TYK2 mutations are relatively rare (PMID: 18270328). While somatic mutations in TYK2 are uncommon, activation of the TYK2/STAT pathway has been found to be oncogenic in many tumor types, including in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and breast cancer (PMID: 23471820, 21864028). TYK2 can also mediate drug resistance to the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib via the formation of drug-resistant TYK2/JAK2 heterodimers (PMID: 22820254).	false

U2AF1 (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1) is the splicing factor subunit protein, U2AF35, which together with its binding partner, U2AF65, regulates the removal of introns from pre-mRNAs to produce mature mRNAs that will be translated during protein synthesis (PMID:1388271). The U2AF1 protein is essential for constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing since it recruits the whole U2AF complex to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA intron that will be spliced (PMID: 8647433, 10617206, 10617208). Mutations in the U2AF1 gene have been found recurrently similarly in hematological malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (PMID:22389253) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (PMID: 22158538) or Chronic Myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (PMID: 22323480). Interestingly it has been proposed that mutations in RNA splicing genes are drivers of the transition from MDS to different sort of myeloid leukemias (PMID:24030381). Therefore, the U2AF1 protein has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target (PMID: 21909114, 22158538, 22323480, 25965570, 25326705). Importantly, it has been shown that mutations in the U2AF1 gene happen early in leukemia development as it has been shown in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) and can persist during disease progression (PMID:25550361).	false

U2AF2 (also U2AF65) is an RNA binding protein that functions as the large component of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) protein complex (PMID: 1285125, 21753750, 25901584). The U2AF complex is necessary for the binding of U2 small nuclear RNA molecules to the pre-mRNA branch site, which is required for formation of the pre-spliceosome complex and 3â splice site selection (PMID: 7685763, 9528748). U2AF2 specifically coordinates the annealing of complementary sequences, RNA binding and regulation of RNA helicases to mediate the formation of duplex RNA (PMID: 7685763). U2AF regulates the splicing of many genes at enhancer-dependent introns including WT1 (PMID: 9784496) and FAS (PMID: 16109372), among others (PMID: 11421359). In addition, U2AF2 has a role in the nuclear export of mRNA (PMID: 11724776) and immune regulation (PMID: 29275860). Altered U2AF2 function has been linked to diseases associated with neurodegeneration due to the presence of CAG repeats in mRNA (PMID: 21725067). U2AF2 mediates alternative splicing of CD44 in melanoma, resulting in CD44 alternative isoforms that mediate tumor progression and metastasis (PMID: 27041584). Somatic U2AF2 mutations are found in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (PMID: 22389253). U2AF2 alterations reduce the affinity of U2AF2 for the splice acceptor site resulting in mis-spliced mRNA transcripts (PMID: 25311244, 28850223).	false

UBE2A, a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, functions in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of protein degradation (PMID: 26476408). UBE2A accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex UBE1 via a trans-thioesterification reaction to catalyze association with E3 ligases and ubiquitination of target proteins (PMID: 20061386, 19325620). DNA polymerase cofactor PCNA is a target for UBE2A ubiquitination, activating the proteinâs translesion DNA repair following DNA damage (PMID: 36162503, 30531907). UBE2A amplification in cancer cell lines induces chromosomal instability and transformation, suggesting that UBE2A functions primarily as an oncogene (PMID: 11929833).

UBR5 (also EDD, HYD) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is a member of the HECT ligase family (PMID: 10030672). E3 ligase proteins define substrate specificity for proteins targeted to the proteasome for degradation. UBR5 appears to target proteins for degradation via the N-end rule for substrates, identifying proteins for degradation based on N-terminal amino acids (PMID: 16055722, 17462990). UBR5 is responsible for the degradation of a variety of substrates including PAIP2, a poly-A tail regulatory binding protein, and TOPBP1, a DNA damage protein (PMID: 16601676, 11714696). UBR5 has also been implicated in the regulation of WNT activity by directly ubiquitinating Î²-catenin (PMID: 28689657). UBR5 has a number of additional substrates that are involved in translational elongation, telomerase activity, gluconeogenesis, epigenetic regulation and histone degradation after DNA damage (PMID: 21127351, 21726808, 23362280, 27647897, 27647897). In addition, UBR5 is an important regulator of the cell cycle DNA damage checkpoint and loss of UBR5 results in the accumulation of polyploid cells, suggesting a role in genome stability (PMID: 17074762, 18073532, 21383020, 25833949). Overexpression of UBR5 has been identified in patients with breast and ovarian cancer and is associated with poorer patient outcome (PMID: 28330927, 12902990, 18349819). Increased UBR5 expression is linked to metastasis and cisplatin resistance in ovarian and breast cancer cells (PMID: 28330927, 24379240).

Following recruitment of UPF1 to target mRNA substrates, UPF1 scans the mRNA transcript, remodels the messenger ribonucleoprotein complex, and regulates the degradation of target transcripts (PMID: 21145460). Disruption of UPF1 function results in decreased nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (PMID: 28663146). Somatic mutations in the UPF1 gene have been identified in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PMID: 24859531) and decreased levels of UPF1 in lung adenocarcinoma has been associated with tumor progression (PMID: 28663146). UPF1 function is associated with prostate cancer metastasis (PMID: 23881279) and with SMAD7-mediated tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (PMID: 26759305).	false

USP8 (also UBPY) is a ubiquitin isopeptidase that is a member of the UBP hydrolase family (PMID: 9628861). Ubiquitin hydrolases deubiquitinate target proteins, protecting them from degradation via the proteasome or lysosome (PMID: 16120644). USP8 mediates the stabilization of numerous proteins, including growth factor receptors such as EGFR (PMID: 16120644, 25675982, 30221684, 29933386, 29626091). Because USP8 is important in the regulation of a variety of proteins, USP8 activity mediates various cellular processes including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and ciliogenesis, among others (PMID: 29472535, 27321185, 26683461). USP8 phosphorylation recruits the adaptor molecule 14-3-3, leading to inactivation of USP8 catalytic activity (PMID: 17720156, 20736164, 29473952). Stabilization of USP8 results in the inability of target substrates to be appropriately targeted for degradation (PMID: 25675982). Recurrent gain-of-function mutations in USP8 are found in patients with Cushing's disease, a disorder that results in the overproduction of cortisol and development of associated tumors that localize to the pituitary gland (PMID: 25675982, 28505279, 28982703, 30315484). USP8 mutations that are associated with Cushing's disease commonly occur in the 14-3-3 binding region, resulting in uncontrolled activation of USP8 (PMID: 25675982). Altered USP8 expression results in the increased expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is overproduced in Cushingâs disease (PMID: 25675982). Overexpression of USP8 has been identified in several cancer types (PMID: 29880877, 23748694).	false

VAV1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is a member of the VAV family of proteins (PMID: 26353933). GEFs are proteins that regulate the activity of monomeric GTPases by coordinating the binding of GTP and the release of GDP (PMID: 26353933). VAV1 is expressed predominantly in the hematopoietic system and has selective substrate specificity for the GTPase Rac (PMID: 11781818). The activity of VAV1 is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (PMID: 11781818) via several tyrosine kinases dependent on cellular context including TCR (T cell receptor), BCR (B cell receptor), and chemokine receptors (PMID: 1531699, 1375396, 10092764, 15872091). VAV1 signaling is required for appropriate lineage commitment and differentiation in a variety of hematopoietic cell types (PMID: 26353933). VAV1 has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including T cell function, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, MAPK signaling and transcriptional regulation (PMID: 15886116, 10669724). In a hematopoietic screen, VAV1 was determined to have activity as a proto-oncogene (PMID: 2477241), but can also have tumor suppressive activity in functional studies (PMID: 23342133, 30297765, 26353933). Somatic mutations in VAV1 are found in T-cell leukemias/lymphomas and lung adenocarcinomas, among others (PMID: 26437031, 27369867, 28062691, 27158780, 25426554) and are predicted to be gain-of-function. Fusion proteins containing VAV1 have also been identified in peripheral T-cell lymphomas and other hematopoietic malignancies (PMID: 28062691, 28832024). Overexpression of VAV1 is found across a range of solid tumors, suggesting VAV1 predominantly functions as an oncogene in this context (PMID: 19533802, 23342133, 15652748).	false

VAV2 signaling is required for appropriate lineage commitment and differentiation in a variety of hematopoietic cell types, with some redundant and non-redundant roles with family members VAV1 and VAV3 (PMID: 14623913, 15941910). In transformation assays, VAV2 was implicated as an oncogene and mediates cell proliferation and foci formation (PMID: 8710375). Overexpression of VAV2 is implicated in a variety of cancer types including breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) (PMID: 26910843, 17234718, 23033540). Somatic mutations in VAV2 are rare; however, VAV2 coordinates cellular proliferation and invasion in various cancer models via an EGFR/RAC1 signaling pathway (PMID: 20940296).	false

VEGFA is commonly over-expressed in many solid tumors.	VEGFA (also VEGF) is a growth factor that is a member of the family of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). VEGFA binds the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 to mediate downstream signaling, with almost all of the known cellular responses mediated by VEGFR2 (PMID: 16951216). Other types of receptors contribute to VEGFA signaling, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PMID: 17470632) and neuropilins (PMID: 22948112, 23116416). Expression of VEGFA is critical for mediating angiogenesis and vascular permeability, stimulating the migration and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (PMID: 24263190). Autocrine VEGF signaling contributes to angiogenesis and cell proliferation (PMID: 22693250) and has been shown to promote the function of cancer stem cells (PMID: 22012397, 20141840). Paracrine VEGFA signaling also impacts the function of nearby immune cells (PMID: 23045606) and fibroblasts (PMID: 22738912, 21057529). Overexpression of VEGFA has been associated with the familial disorder Crow-Fulcase syndrome that is characterized by reduced vasopermeability (PMID: 9771661). VEGFA predominantly functions as an oncogene in human cancers and is commonly overexpressed in many solid tumor types, likely mediating enhanced tumor angiogenesis (PMID: 24263190). The VEGFA inhibitors bevacizumab (PMID: 17212999) and aflibercept (PMID: 22446028) are FDA-approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and glioblastoma.	false	
ENST00000256474	NM_000551.3	ENST00000256474	NM_000551.3	7428	VHL	false			VHL is a tumor suppressor involved in protein degradation. Germline mutations of VHL are associated with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and predispose to renal cell carcinoma.	VHL is an E3 ligase that functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 10102622, 9671762). The VHL protein forms a ternary complex with transcription elongation factors B and C, which is critical for the stabilization and activity of VHL (PMID: 25533676). VHL mutations that disrupt this complex lead to an unstable VHL protein that is aberrantly degraded (PMID: 7660130, 7660122). Under normal oxygen conditions, VHL plays a crucial role in the regulation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs); VHL binds HIF proteins and targets them for ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (PMID: 10878807). HIFs are responsible for transcription of numerous genes in response to hypoxic conditions, including pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (PMID: 25533676). Loss of VHL leads to activation of HIF downstream target genes and can promote tumorigenesis in normoxic conditions (PMID: 21386872). VHL loss can cause hereditary and sporadic forms of von Hippel-Lindau disease, which is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, retinal hemangioblastomas, phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PMID: 18676741, 25533676). Somatic functional inactivation of VHL has been reported through bi-allelic loss of the VHL gene in cases of 3p deletion (PMID: 2885753), heterozygous VHL mutations (PMID: 7915601, 21715564) or promoter methylation (PMID: 7937876) in human cancers. Inhibitors that target VEGF receptors and HIF proteins may have therapeutic efficacy in tumors with VHL loss (PMID: 25533676).	true

B7-H4 is highly expressed in various human tumors.	VTCN1 encodes the V-set domain containing T cell activation inhibitor 1, also known as B7-H4 and plays critical roles in regulating T cell-mediated immune response through inhibiting T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and the development of cytotoxicity (PMID: 19641607, 12818166, 14568939). B7-H4 is highly expressed in various human tumors, including breast (PMID: 15756008, 15878339), ovarian (PMID: 19955922), lung (PMID: 16782226, 23874109), pancreatic (PMID: 25170273), gastric (PMID: 20872810, 21748517) and urothelial cell carcinoma (PMID: 25400757, 25364421).

WIF1 is an extracellular lipid-binding protein that functions as a WNT antagonist (PMID: 10201374, 24316024, 23258168). WIF1 functions as a negative regulator of the WNT signaling pathway by binding to WNT or Frizzled (Fz) receptors and precluding WNT-mediated activation of downstream signaling (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). WNT signaling is a critical developmental pathway with roles in determining cell fate, tissue identity and polarity (PMID:  28218291). WIF1-mediated antagonism of WNT results in the activation of the Î²-catenin destruction complex (containing APC, GSK3Î² and AXIN), which targets Î²-catenin for degradation (PMID: 23258168). In the absence of WNT signaling, TCF and LEF transcription factors form a repressive complex, leading to inhibition of Î²-catenin target genes (PMID: 24316024, 23258168). In addition to roles in antagonizing WNT, WIF1 has roles in mesodermal specification, cellular senescence, tissue homeostasis and proliferation (PMID: 24853424, 10201374, 30574494). Germline mutations in WIF1 have been found in families with a predisposition to cancer, as well as in patients with Nail-Patella syndrome (PMID: 25716654, 28383544). Somatic mutations in WIF1 are not well studied in human cancers; however, rare alterations are found in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (PMID: 23292937). Epigenetic silencing of WIF1 transcription and WIF1 overexpression have both been implicated in distinct cancer types, suggesting that WIF1 may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in different cellular contexts (PMID: 20596629, 26291085, 25432628, 15579438). Fusion proteins involving WIF1 are also found in adenomyoepitheliomas, a rare breast cancer, and in salivary gland tumors (PMID: 30675516, 17171686, 18828159).	true

WT1 (Wilms tumor 1 gene) is a transcription factor expressed in a tissue-specific manner throughout development (PMID: 20013787, 17524167, 17361230, 12835718). WT1 has been implicated in the protein stabilization of TP53 and regulates the expression of several target genes include MYC and BCL2, which are important for cellular growth and metabolism (PMID: 7585606, 8389468). In hematopoietic cells, WT1 interacts with the epigenetic proteins TET2 and TET3 that regulate hydroxymethylation of DNA, an epigenetic modification of DNA that may also serve as a methylation state intermediate (PMID: 25482556). Loss of WT1 expression results in depletion of global 5-hydroxymethylation levels (PMID: 25482556), implicating WT1 in the regulation of DNA methylation. WT1 was initially discovered as a tumor suppressor in Wilmsâ tumor (PMID: 2163761, 9090524); however, WT1 loss only contributes to the pathogenesis of a fraction of Wilms' tumors (PMID: 16110318). Somatic WT1 mutations have been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are predicted to be loss-of-function, leading to decreased DNA binding activity (PMID: 25482556). Importantly, TET and IDH family mutations are mutually exclusive with WT1 mutations in AML patients, suggesting that WT1 functions as a regulator of DNA methylation (PMID: 25482556). Patients with WT1 mutations may be increasingly sensitive to hypomethylating agents, such as azacytidine, due to the role of WT1 in the regulation of methylation (PMID: 27252512). WT1 is overexpressed in a large percentage of patients with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (PMID: 27252512, 16461320, 15084694). Vaccines that target overexpression of WT1 are currently in clinical development (PMID: 23486779, 26389576).	true

WWP1 (WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates diverse processes in the cell, including protein trafficking and signaling (PMID: 22051607). WWP1 is responsible for mediating the polyubiquitination of PTEN. When polyubiquitinated, PTEN is prevented from dimerizing, localizing to the membrane and functioning as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 31097636). Thus, WWP1 is responsible for PTEN inactivation. WWP1 is also involved in TGF-beta signaling by regulating the degradation of Smad2 (PMID: 15221015). WWP1 knockout in cell lines leads to decreased colony formation and increased apoptosis compared to wildtype, while xenograft tumors carrying WWP1 mutations exhibit increased growth rate compared to wildtype (PMID: 31097636, 32459922). WWP1 is amplified and/or overexpressed in breast, prostate and gastric cancers, among others (PMID: 17330240, 17016436, 25293520).

The WWTR1 gene encodes the WWTR1/TAZ protein, a transcriptional coactivator involved in the Hippo signaling pathway (PMID: 26045258, 25266986). TAZ, which shares homology and function with the Yes-associated protein (YAP), is able to translocate to the nucleus and interact with TEAD1-4 to activate a transcriptional program that promotes cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PMID: 11118213, 18227151, 19324877). The Hippo signaling pathway negatively regulates TAZ function via LATS1/2 phosphorylation, which prevents TAZ nuclear translocation (PMID: 18227151). WWTR1/TAZ is considered a novel oncogene in breast and lung cancer (PMID: 18413727, 21258416). WWTR1 is amplified in several tumors, such as lung, ovarian and head and neck cancer (cBioPortal, MSKCC, Nov 2016).

XBP1 is a transcription factor that is an important regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (PMID: 28741511). XBP1 undergoes unconventional splicing after the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resulting in the activation of UPR (PMID: 28741511). The function of the UPR is to stop protein translation, degrade abnormal proteins, and increase chaperone production in response to ER stress; otherwise, the cell is targeted for apoptosis (PMID: 21061914). The transmembrane protein IRE1Î± coordinates the splicing of XBP1 upon ER stress, resulting in a newly spliced transcript that contains a transactivation domain, which is critical for mediating UPR transcriptional activity in the nucleus (PMID: 28741511, 19609461). XBP1 has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including adaptive immunity, innate immunity, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, DNA repair, lipid metabolism, cellular differentiation, and DNA replication, among others (PMID: 17612490, 21061914, 12612580). Variants in XBP1 have been linked to inflammatory bowel syndrome and Crohnâs disease (PMID: 18775308). Overexpression of XBP1 expression has been found in leukemias and breast cancers (PMID: 16491124, 19470730, 20028872). Increased XBP1 activity is important for the growth of tumor cells in hypoxic conditions (PMID: 15342372) and can mediate drug resistance (PMID: 17660348). Somatic mutations in XBP1 are found in patients with follicular lymphoma (PMID: 27959929), however, these alterations have not been functionally characterized.	false

XIAP encodes for the gene X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the family of baculovirus IAP domain repeat-containing proteins (PMID:25065885). The IAP domain mediates anti-apoptotic activity by binding and inhibiting caspases and is blocked by SMAC protein binding (PMID:9230442, 11242052). XIAP also contains a RING domain that mediates ubiquitination through E3 ligase activity (PMID:15803136, 18708583). It regulates Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response, MAPK signaling, copper metabolism, and cellular differentiation (PMID: 24975362, 24497535, 20154138, 19011619, 23928917). In cancer, XIAP can mediate resistance to therapy (PMID:23727860, 22491673, 11280739, 12384799). Gerrmline mutations are associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome characterized by lymphohystiocytosis, hypogammaglobulinaemia, lymphomas, and immune disorders (PMID: 17080092, 23973892).

XPC encodes for a DNA damage repair factor which functions as a DNA binding component of the XPC-RAD23B complex (PMID: 10873465, 20028083, 20798892). The XPC-RAD23B complex is a part of the nucleotide excision repair mechanism and recognizes DNA lesions to initiate DNA repair (PMID: 33035795, 31372632). Germline mutations of XPC are associated with the autosomal recessive disease xeroderma pigmentosum, resulting in a decreased ability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet rays (PMID: 27413738). Knockdown of XPC in various cancer cell lines and models induces tumor formation, oxidative DNA damage and cellular proliferation and migration, suggesting that XPC functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene (PMID: 21763452, 9540983, 25871391).

The XPO1 (Exportin 1) encodes a protein that mediates nuclear export of proteins and RNA (PMID: 9323132, 10786834). XPO1 recognizes proteins containing a nuclear export signal (NES) and leads to their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. XPO1 has been reported to be involved in ribosome biogenesis by exporting the 60S ribosome subunit through binding to NMD3 (PMID: 26048327, 12724356). In the context of cancer, XPO1 has oncogenic properties. This has been mostly attributed to the fact that proteins exported by XPO1 include important tumor suppressors (eg. APC, TP53, SMARCB1 etc.)(PMID: 12070164, 11782423, 17891139, 20803015).

Germline mutations of XRCC2 are associated with an increased risk developing of breast cancer.	XRCC2 is a member of the RAD51 recombinase family that functions in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). RAD51 acts at an early step in the DSB pathway: the 5âended DNA strands flanking the DSB break site are resected and the single-stranded overhangs are coated by RAD51 forming a nucleo-protein filament (PMID: 25833843). XRCC2 is a member of the BCDX2 complex that includes the RAD51 paralogs RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D. The BCDX2 complex stabilizes the sites of damaged DNA and recruits RAD51 to initiate strand repair by homologous recombination (PMID: 9126486,10517641). Knockdown of XRCC2 activity in cell line and murine models results in a 100-fold decrease in DSB repair function through defective homologous recombination repair (PMID: 10517641, 14678973, 14645207, 24627042). There is conflicting data on whether germline variants of XRCC2 increase the risk of breast cancer (PMID: 22464251, 23054243,12023982,17141189) and XRCC2 is infrequently mutated in human cancers.	true

High expression of YAP due to gene amplification or epigenetic activation is found in a diverse range of human cancers.	YAP1 is a transcriptional co-activator and downstream effector of the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway is involved in several processes of cancer progression and physiologically has important regulatory functions in organ development and regeneration (PMID: 23467301, 24825474, 24336504). YAP1 largely mediates the downstream transcriptional effects of Hippo signaling (PMID: 20951342) by shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In the nucleus, YAP1 induces expression of proliferative and anti-apoptotic genes via interactions with transcription factors, namely TEAD family members (PMID: 20951342). Hyperactivation of YAP1 leads to contact-inhibition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastatic potential and stem cell defects (PMID: 17974916, 24336504, 25702974). Germline mutations in YAP1 have been identified in patients with coloboma, a familial disorder resulting in ocular defects (PMID: 24462371). Overexpression of YAP1 is widespread in human cancer; however, somatic mutations are rare (PMID: 25592648, 24336504). Reports of YAP1 gene amplification and epigenetic activation in cancer support the role of YAP1 as a classic oncogene (PMID: 25592648, 24336504). YAP1 fusions have also been identified in ependymomas (PMID: 29258295). Although YAP1 behaves as an oncogene in most cancers, data suggest that YAP1 can also act as a tumor suppressor in certain cellular contexts (PMID: 24976009, 22234184). Overexpression of YAP1 has been associated with resistance to MEK and BRAF inhibitors (PMID: 25665005). Verteporfin, a small molecule inhibitor that targets the YAP1-TEAD interaction, has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of YAP1 overexpression and is synthetic lethal with MEK and BRAF inhibition (PMID: 29299145).	false	
ENST00000314574	NM_005433.3	ENST00000314574	NM_005433.3	7525	YES1	true			YES1 encodes a tyrosine kinase involved in regulation of cell growth and survival, apoptosis, cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling and differentiation. Overexpression of YES1 is found in colorectal, hepatocellular, breast and esophageal cancers and melanomas.	YES1 is a non-receptor SRC protein tyrosine kinase that is activated by growth-factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, including PDGFR, EGFR and VEGFR (PMID: 8356071, 12496267, 16400523). Following activation, YES1 phosphorylates various substrates, including CDK4 and PAR3 to control cell cycle progression and regulate cell-cell adhesion (PMID: 18479465, 17053785). Additionally, YES1 stimulates chemokine-directed T-cell migration by phosphorylating collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), promotes cell migration through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in hepatocytes through its participation in the CD95L signaling pathway (PMID: 19276087, 21713032, 15917250). YES1 plays a central role in malignant mesothelioma cell growth (PMID: 22948717) and has been shown to act as an oncogene in several tumor models through increased expression and kinase activity (PMID: 7690925, 9816313, 17007035, 7690926). YES1 is amplified in basal-like breast cancer and esophageal squamous carcinoma (PMID: 21779430, 11756219) and has been implicated in resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer (PMID: 28158234). In colorectal carcinoma, increased YES1 activation correlates with poor prognosis, as YES1 activity is elevated in adenomas with the highest risk (PMID: 7806032). However, somatic YES1 mutations are rare in human cancers.	false

Germline mutations in ZBTB20 are found in patients with Primrose syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders.	ZBTB20 is a transcription factor that is a member of the BTB/POZ family of DNA binding proteins. ZBTB20 is most highly expressed during hippocampus development and in mature endocrine cells (PMID: 26782407, 27079169). Deletion of ZBTB20 in mice results in decreased secretion of pituitary growth hormones, such as prolactin (PRL), and loss of mature lactotrope cells in the anterior pituitary (PMID: 26782407, 27079169). ZBTB20 directly binds the promoter of PRL and activates transcription (PMID: 27079169) and PRL overexpression has been implicated in ZBTB20-dependent models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (PMID: 31570595). Expression of ZBTB20 is important in immune regulation in B cells, including in plasma cell differentiation and longevity (PMID: 29616049, 24711583, 23776228). The deletion of ZBTB20 in murine models can result in long-term antibody defects (PMID: 29616049). The activity of ZBTB20 has been implicated in other cellular functions including liver regeneration, lipogenesis, neuronal development and maintenance of circadian rhythms, among others (PMID: 29700307, 27657167, 27000654, 25564625, 28327662). Germline mutations in ZBTB20 are associated with Primrose syndrome, a congenital malformation syndrome associated with abnormal immunoglobulin levels, as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders (PMID: 31821719, 31321892, 29681083, 25017102). These loss-of-function alterations lead to alterations in dendritic spine morphology (PMID: 30281617). ZBTB20 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in the context of PTEN loss (PMID: 28319090); however, overexpression of ZBTB20 is also associated with poor prognosis and metastatic progression in several cancer types including hepatocellular and lung cancers (PMID: 31556767, 26893361, 21702992, 25311537).	true

ZBTB7A, a member of the POK family of transcriptional repressors, encodes for a zinc finger transcription factor that functions in the repression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation (PMID: 17595526, 14701838, 11865059). ZBTB7A negatively regulates SMAD4 transcriptional activity in the TGF-Î² signaling pathway through recruitment of chromatin regulator HDAC1 to the SMAD4-DNA complex and by preventing further recruitment of transcriptional activators (PMID: 25514493). ZBTB7A can function as an AR transcriptional corepressor through the recruitment of NCOR1 and NCOR2 to suppress AR-mediated signaling and cellular proliferation (PMID: 20812024). The oncogenic function of ZBTB7A is likely tissue-specific. Overexpression of ZBTB7A in various types of cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation and migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, suggesting that ZBTB7A functions predominantly as an oncogene in these tissue contexts (PMID: 17907153, 31385585, 21176152, 33167891). Amplification of ZBTB7A has been identified in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer (PMID: 17907153, 27982429, 33167891). In contrast, the knockdown of ZBTB7A in other types of cancer cell lines and models induces cellular proliferation and tumor metastasis, suggesting that ZBTB7A functions predominantly as a tumor suppressor gene in these tissue contexts (PMID: 36596853, 25184678, 29699474). Downregulation of ZBTB7A has been identified in various cancers, including melanoma, prostate cancer and glioblastoma (PMID: 25995384, 31444154, 36596853).	true

ZFHX3 is a transcription factor expressed in the brain, liver, lung and the gastrointestinal tract. Normally, ZFHX3 suppresses transcription of alpha-fetoprotein by binding to an enhancer motif (PMID: 7507206, 11786962) and negatively regulates expression of the proto-oncogene MYB (PMID: 10318867). ZFHX3 is mutated in advanced gastric cancers (PMID: 17671116, 20599712) and prostate cancer (PMID: 15750593). Functional studies support a tumor suppressor role for this protein. Specifically, a ZFHX3 conditional knockout mouse develops hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PMID: 24934715). Suppression of ZFHX3 in a prostate cell line increases proliferation, while exogenous expression of ZFHX3 decreases soft agar colony formation (PMID: 15750593). In breast cancer, ZFHX3 is not frequently mutated (PMID: 16932943, 18796146), however, it can inhibit estrogen receptor-mediated cell proliferation (PMID: 20720010).	true

ZFP36L1 is a critical regulator of mRNA decay and binds to adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (ARE), which are located in the 3â untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs (PMID: 31551365, 25106868). ZFP36L1 binds the 3â UTR of many cancer and cell-cycle related genes including HIF1A, CCND1, and E2F1 (PMID: 31551365, 29709483, 29426877). In addition, ZFP36L1 can bind to other proteins involved in mRNA degradation including mRNA decapping subunits, the exosome component RRP4, and deadenylases, among others (PMID: 15687258). Overexpression of ZFP36L1 in cancer cell lines results in reduced proliferation and cell cycle progression, suggesting that ZFP36L1 predominantly functions as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 31551365, 26542173). Deletion of ZFP36L1 in mice results in a severe defect in B-cell development, due to the role of ZFP36L1 in mediating cellular quiescence, which is required for the maintenance of genomic integrity during V(D)J recombination (PMID: 27102483, 28394372). ZFP36L1 has also been implicated in thymocyte development, and loss of ZFP36L1 results in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias in mice (PMID: 20622884, 27566829). ZFP36L1 is also involved in the regulation of other cellular functions including differentiation, apoptosis, fate specification and hypoxia (PMID: 31551365, 30982771, 28206953, 26542173, 25014217, 26542173). Somatic mutations of ZFP36L1 have been identified in several cancer types, including breast and bladder cancer (PMID: 31551365).

WNT signaling is activated following ligand engagement of WNT receptors and co-receptors, including Frizzled (FZD) and LRP5/6, resulting in increased downstream signaling (PMID: 30692207, 24225776, 22575959). ZNRF3 antagonizes WNT signaling by targeting FZD and LRP6 for degradation via ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis (PMID: 30692207, 22575959, 24349440). Other WNT signaling molecules, including the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DSH), are required to mediate the activity of ZNRF3 at the membrane (PMID: 22575959, 22895187, 25891077).
