# How to use djerba-demo

## Introduction

This document contains detailed instructions for how to install, test, and run [djerba-demo](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba-demo).

### Terminology

- *Plugin*: Main sub-unit of Djerba. Reads INI config; reads/writes JSON; writes HTML and PDF.
- *Merger*: Merges, deduplicates, and renders output from one or more plugins.
- *Helper*: Writes data for use by plugins.
- *Component*: A plugin, helper, or merger. Djerba components share a common structure and configuration syntax.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- `djerba-demo` is a lightweight demonstration; 4 GB of RAM and a 1 GHz processor should be more than sufficient.

### Operating system

- Djerba runs in production under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Other versions of Linux should work with no difficulty.
- Limited testing of Djerba has successfully been carried out on MacOS.
- Djerba has _not_ been tested on Windows, and issues are likely to occur.
- If you do not have access to a Linux machine, we recommend setting up an Ubuntu VM in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run `djerba-demo`.

### Software

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.10 or greater
- The [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) binary must be on the system `PATH`.
- For best results, the Arial font family should be installed (in `$HOME/.local/share/fonts` on a Linux machine).
- That's it! Production plugins at OICR have additional dependencies, but `djerba-demo` is intended to be as lightweight as possible.

## Installation

### 1. Set up and activate a Python virtual environment

We recommend installing Djerba to a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), instead of the system Python directory.
- Choose a directory `$MY_VENV_DIR` in which to make your venv
- The `python3` command may be the system Python, or it may be a version of Python installed separately; the only requirement is for the Python version to be 3.10 or greater.
- Proceed to set up and activate the venv as follows:

```
cd $MY_VENV_DIR
mkdir djerba-demo
python3 -m venv djerba-demo
source djerba-demo/bin/activate
```

### 2. Clone or download the djerba-demo repository

```
git clone git@github.com:oicr-gsi/djerba-demo.git
cd djerba-demo
```

Alternatively:
```
wget https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba-demo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd djerba-demo-main
```

### 3. Install using pip

- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) is the standard package installer for Python.
- The following command will install Djerba into your virtual environment.

```
pip3 install .
```

## Testing

Run the Djerba core tests to ensure the installation is working properly.

```
source ./src/test/test_env.sh
./src/test/core/test_core.py
```

You should see something like this:

```
.................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 33 tests in 2.994s

OK
```

## Generating a report

We can now generate a Djerba report. This will be done with two very simple _plugins_ called `demo1` and `demo2`; and a _merger_ called `gene_information_merger`.

We will set up a working directory; edit a config file with values of our choice; and generate a PDF report.

### 1. Set up a working directory

- Choose an appropriate directory for Djerba input and output files.
- Djerba uses a workspace directory to write intermediate output files; it can be anywhere, but we will put it in a subdirectory called `work`.

```
cd $MY_TEST_DIR
mkdir work
```

### 2. Generate and edit an INI config file

- We use Djerba in `setup` mode to generate a blank INI config file.

```
djerba.py setup --assay DEMO --compact
```

You will now see a file called `config.ini` with the following contents:

```
[core]

[demo1]
integer = REQUIRED

[demo2]
integer_2 = REQUIRED

[gene_information_merger]
```

The file is in the standard INI config format, as implemented in the Python [ConfigParser module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure). We can see it has sections for the Djerba core, two plugins and a merger. Let us fill in appropriate values:

```
[core]

[demo1]
integer = 5

[demo2]
integer_2 = 23

[gene_information_merger]
```

### 3. Create a Djerba report

We can generate a report with this command:

```
djerba.py --verbose report --ini config.ini --out-dir work --no-archive --pdf
```

Some explanation of the options:
- `--verbose` writes additional logging information to the terminal
- `--ini` and `--out-dir` are the INI config and output directory, respectively
- `--no-archive` omits upload of the report to a database, since we haven't set that up
- `--pdf` generates a PDF document

You should see logging output, concluding with something like:
```
2024-07-09_16:52:00 djerba.core.main INFO: Wrote HTML output to work/OICR-CGI-7421acae21f34612a2fc66a1bd02671e_report.clinical.html
2024-07-09_16:52:00 djerba.core.render INFO: Writing PDF to work/OICR-CGI-7421acae21f34612a2fc66a1bd02671e_report.clinical.pdf
2024-07-09_16:52:01 djerba.core.render INFO: Finished writing PDF
2024-07-09_16:52:01 djerba.core.main INFO: Wrote PDF output to work/OICR-CGI-7421acae21f34612a2fc66a1bd02671e_report.clinical.pdf
2024-07-09_16:52:01 djerba.core.main INFO: Finished Djerba render step
```

Note the somewhat unwieldy filename `OICR-CGI-7421acae21f34612a2fc66a1bd02671e_report.clinical.pdf`. The filename derives from an optional `report_id` parameter -- if none is specified, Djerba generates a globally unique identifier. How to modify this is further discussed below.

### 4. View the HTML/PDF

The `report` command above has written HTML and PDF report documents in the `work` directory, which should look like this:

![Djerba report](./doc/simple_demo.png)

### 5. View the JSON

Djerba writes a machine-readable JSON file which is used to generate the HTML and PDF. It can also be stored in a database, parsed and queried by other scripts.

We can view the JSON as follows (substituting the unique filename of your report):
```
cat work/OICR-CGI-7421acae21f34612a2fc66a1bd02671e_report.json | python3 -m json.tool | less
```

- Example JSON is shown below.
- Djerba has a flexible structure, in which each plugin can record arbitrary JSON data in its `results` attribute.
- The `merge_inputs` section has inputs for the `gene_information_merger` which was listed in our INI config file.
- The `priorities` section controls the order in which plugins are run, and assembled into a document.
- The `attributes` section allows us to specify various report types, such as clinically-accredited and research-only.

                "integer": 5

        },
	...
```

### 6. More workspace files

In addition to the HTML, PDF and JSON, our working directory contains two other files.

#### full_config.ini

This is a _fully specified_ INI configuration file, generated by Djerba at runtime.

We can see that it includes some additional parameters, such as the priorities and attributes we saw in the JSON, and placeholder settings for database upload.

#### integer.txt

This file was written by the `demo1` plugin, and read by the `demo2` plugin. Reading and writing files in the workspace allows Djerba components to communicate with each other. For instance, OICR uses a _helper_ component to write gene expression values; a plugin identifies relevant SNVs, reads the expression values, and outputs a table which includes the expression value for each SNV. Meanwhile, _another_ plugin identifies relevant CNVs, and writes a table with different variants, which also includes expression values from the expression helper.

### 7. More Djerba Parameters

We have generated a very simple Djerba report; but Djerba has many more capabilities. For example, we can modify some additional parameters. Let us set the report ID and author name as follows:

```
[core]
author = Katniss Everdeen
report_id = demo_001      

[demo1]
integer = 7

[demo2]
integer_2 = 35

[gene_information_merger]
```

We save this as `config2.ini`, make a new working directory `work2`, and generate another report:

```
djerba.py --verbose report --ini config2.ini --out-dir work2 --no-archive --pdf
```

Our `work2` directory should now contain a file `demo_001_report.clinical.pdf` which looks like this:

![Djerba report](./doc/simple_demo_2.png)

## Conclusion

This document has walked through a simple demonstration of installing and running Djerba.

For answers to common questions, see the [FAQ](./FAQ.md) file.

Production reports at OICR use a wide range of Djerba plugins, which can do arbitrary data processing, record the results as JSON, and assemble them into a report. See the [main Djerba repository](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba) and [documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://djerba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for additional examples and information.
